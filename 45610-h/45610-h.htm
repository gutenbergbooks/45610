<h2>PREFACE<a id="preface"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> aim of this book is to present to
the reading public sketches of some of
its American literary heroes. There
are heroes young and old; but in literature,
especially, age has little to do with favorites.
At the same time, it will be noted that the
subjects of these sketches occupy places in or
near the centre of the literary stage. The
lately dead, like Maurice Thompson; the hero
of the last generation, like Edward Everett
Hale; the young man who has made his first
successful flight&mdash;these do not come within
the scope of the present work. So, if some
reader miss his favorite, let him understand
that at least there was no malice in the
exclusion.</i></p>

<p><i>A part of the aim has been to present the
social or personal as well as the professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
side of the authors. Many of the anecdotes
commonly told of well-known novelists are
apocryphal or imaginary. Care, therefore,
has been taken to separate the wheat from the
chaff. Wherever it was possible, preference
has been given the statements of the authors
themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>The sketches are arranged chronologically,
that is, in the order of the authors' first
publications. No other arrangement, indeed,
would seem fair among so gifted and popular
a company, writing for a public that discriminates
while it encourages and enjoys.</i></p>

<h2>WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS<a id="howells"></a></h2>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">M</span></i><span class="smcap">r. Howells</span> has reached that
point of life and success where
he can afford to sit down and
look back. But he is not that sort of man.
He will probably continue to work and to
look forward until, in the words of Hamlet,
he shuffles off this mortal coil.</p>

<p>William Dean Howells was born in Martin's
Ferry, Belmont County, Ohio, March
1, 1837. He has therefore reached the
ripe age of sixty-four. When he was three
years old his father moved from Martin's
Ferry to Hamilton and bought <i>The Intelligencer</i>,
a weekly paper. Nine years afterward
he sold <i>The Intelligencer</i> and moved
to Dayton, becoming proprietor of the
<i>Dayton Transcript</i>. This paper had been a
semi-weekly, but Mr. Howells changed it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a daily; and his son William went to work
for him. It was William's business to
rise at four in the morning and sell the
paper about town. But the <i>Transcript</i>
proved a failure, so the Howells family left
Dayton and moved into the country on the
banks of the Miami, where for a year a
log-cabin was their home.</p>

<p>Mr. Howells tells a characteristic story
of those struggling days, "When I was a
boy," he said some years ago, "I worked
on my father's paper. Among other things,
I set type. Those were days of great
struggle for all of us. The paper was not
profitable, and ours was a large family. My
tastes and ambitions were all literary, and
I wanted to write a story. Instead of
writing it and then setting it up in type, I
composed it at the case and put it in type
as I invented it. We printed a chapter of
it weekly in the paper, and so it was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as fast as I got it up. I tried to get
three or four chapters ready in advance,
but I could not do it. All I could possibly
accomplish was to have one installment
ready every time the paper went to press.
This went on for a long while, and that
story became a burden to me. It stretched
out longer and longer, but I could see no
way to end it. Every week I resolved that
that story should be finished in the next
week's paper; every week it refused to be
finished. Finally I became positively panic
stricken, and ended it somehow or other.
The experience discouraged me to some
extent. I made up my mind that I could
not invent."</p>

<p>In 1851, when William was fourteen, the
family moved from the country to Columbus,
where his father got employment as a
clerk in the House of Representatives, and
also as a compositor on the <i>Ohio State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Journal</i>. William went to work as a reporter
on the <i>Journal</i>. Five years later he
became the Columbus correspondent of the
<i>Cincinnati Gazette</i>. In 1859 he took the
position of news editor of the <i>Ohio State
Journal</i>. Later that same year Howells
senior, from whom the son evidently inherited
his industry and ambition, bought
the <i>Ashtabula Sentinel</i> and transferred the
property to Jefferson, whither the family
moved. William took the position of subeditor
of the <i>Sentinel</i>.</p>

<p>From time to time poems by young
Howells had appeared in the Ohio newspapers.
Some of his verses, too, had even
been published by <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.
In 1860, in collaboration with John J.
Piatt, he published his first volume of verse&mdash;"Poems
by Two Friends." In 1860,
also, Howells's "Life of Abraham Lincoln"
was published. With the earnings of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
immediately popular work our author journeyed
to the East by way of Canada. In
Boston he first met James Russell Lowell,
who was then editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.
Afterward he visited the publishers, Messrs.
Ticknor and Fields, primarily in connection
with one of his poems which <i>The Atlantic</i>
then had in hand, "The Pilot's Story."
Mr. Fields introduced Howells to Mr. Ticknor,
"who, I fancied," says Howells in his
"Literary Friends and Acquaintance," "had
not then read my poem; but he seemed to
know what it was from the junior partner,
and he asked me whether I had been paid
for it. I confessed that I had not, and
then he got out a chamois-leather bag, and
took from it five half-eagles in gold and
laid them on the green cloth top of the
desk, in much the shape and of much the
size of the Great Bear. I have never since
felt myself paid so lavishly for any literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
work, though I have had more for a single
piece than the twenty-five dollars that
dazzled me in this constellation. The publisher
seemed aware of the poetic character
of the transaction; he let the pieces lie a
moment, before he gathered them up and
put them into my hand, and said, 'I always
think it is pleasant to have it in
gold.'"</p>

<p>While making his residence in Boston,
Howells met Oliver Wendell Holmes, Hawthorne
and Emerson. Emerson rather discouraged
him by remarking as they were
saying good-bye to each other, that one
might very well give a pleasant hour to
poetry "now and then."</p>

<p>When the young Ohioan met Mr. Fields
again he proposed himself as assistant editor
of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. Mr. Fields replied
that if the post had not just been
filled the intrepid poet certainly should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have had it.</p>

<p>"He was charmingly kind," writes Mr.
Howells of the interview; "he entered with
the sweetest interest into the story of my
economic life, which had been full of changes
and chances already. But when I said
very seriously that I was tired of these
fortuities, and would like to be settled in
something he asked with dancing eyes,</p>

<p>"'Why, how old are you?'</p>

<p>"'I am twenty-three,' I answered, and
then the laughing fit took him again.</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'you begin young, out
there!'"</p>

<p>From 1861 to 1865, during the War of
the Rebellion, Mr. Howells was United
States Consul at Venice, which position
was a reward for his life of Lincoln. In
Venice he wrote occasionally for American
newspapers; and there he also wrote the
articles of which, eventually, his delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
"Venetian Life" and "Italian Journeys"
were composed.</p>

<p>Returning to this country, he re-entered
the newspaper world, working mostly for
the <i>New York Tribune</i> and the <i>New York
Times</i>; and he also became a regular contributor
to <i>The Nation</i>. In 1866 he achieved
his great ambition, Mr. Fields appointing
him assistant editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.
From that year until 1886, when he moved
to New York, he lived on terms of enviable
intimacy with the group of great writers
which made Boston the one brilliant literary
centre the country has ever seen.</p>

<p>However, this success did not come until
after many defeats. Mr. Howells's letters
from Venice were published regularly in
the <i>Boston Advertiser</i>; but elsewhere, for
the most part, the young author had met
little encouragement. It was only just before
he left Venice, when Lowell, then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Prof. Charles Eliot Norton, joint editor of
the <i>North American Review</i>, accepted Howells's
article on "Recent Italian Comedy,"
that the cloud broke. Lowell accepted the
manuscript in "one of his loveliest letters,"
as Mr. Howells says. "His message" the
author confesses, "came after years of
thwarted endeavor, and reinstated me in
the belief that I could still do something in
literature. To be sure, the letters in the
<i>Advertiser</i> had begun to make their impression;
among the first great pleasures they
brought me was a recognition from my diplomatic
chief in Vienna; but I valued my
admission to the <i>North American</i> peculiarly
because it was Lowell let me in, and because
I felt that in his charge it must be
the place of highest honor." Financially,
the encouragement was slight. The <i>North
American</i> was "as poor as it was proud";
and it paid Howells for his article at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rate of only two dollars a page. From the
<i>Advertiser</i> he had been paid at the rate of
about a dollar a thousand words. It was
on March 19, 1866, his twenty-ninth birthday,
that the vagrant author began his work
on <i>The Atlantic</i> at a salary of fifty dollars
a week.</p>

<p>"The whole affair," Mr. Howells writes,
"was conducted by Fields with his unfailing
tact and kindness, but it could not be kept
from me that the qualification I had as
practical printer for the work was most
valued, if not the most valued, and that as
proof-reader I was expected to make it
avail on the side of economy. Somewhere
in life's feast the course of humble-pie must
always come in; and if I did not wholly
relish this bit of it, I dare say it was good
for me, and I digested it perfectly."</p>

<p>It was a most delicate position which he
occupied on <i>The Atlantic</i> from 1866 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
1872, when Fields withdrew and Mr.
Howells became sole editor. In the beginning,
as he says himself, he ventured to
distinguish mediocrity in some verses by
Whittier. "He sent me a poem," says
Howells, "and I had the temerity to return
it, and beg him for something else. He magnanimously
refrained from all show of
offence, and after a while, when he had
printed the poem elsewhere, he gave me
another. By this time, I perceived that I
had been wrong, not as to the poem
returned, but as to my function regarding
him and such as he. I had made my reflections,
and never again did I venture to pass
upon what contributors of his quality sent
me. I took it, and printed it, and praised
the gods; and even now I think that with
such men it was not my duty to play the
censor in the periodical which they had
made what it was. They had set it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
authority over American literature, and it
was not for me to put myself in authority
over them. Their fame was in their own
keeping, and it was not my part to guard
it against them."</p>

<p>At another time, when a choice was
accidentally enforced between a poem by
Holmes and a poem by Emerson, Mr. Howells
had the courage to request Emerson
that his poem might be held over for the
next number. Emerson wrote back to
"return the proofs and break up the forms."
"I could not go to this iconoclastic extreme
with the electrotypes of the magazine,"
says Mr. Howells, "but I could return the
proofs. I did so, feeling that I had done
my possible, and silently grieving that
there could be such ire in heavenly minds."</p>

<p>From 1872 until 1880 Mr. Howells was
sole editor of <i>The Atlantic</i>; and the rich
social and literary experience which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
gained during that term he has embodied
in that most delightful of American bookmen's
chronicles, "Literary Friends and
Acquaintance."</p>

<p>Mr. Howells's first piece of fiction, "Their
Wedding Journey," was published in 1872,
the year that he became sole editor of <i>The
Atlantic</i>. Seven years ago in a newspaper
interview, Mr. Howells made this statement
in regard to this work: "I wrote 'Their
Wedding Journey' without intending to
make it a piece of fiction or considering it
to be one after I had finished it. It was
simply a book of American travel, which I
hoped to make attractive by a sugar coating
of romance. I was very familiar with the
route over which I had taken the bridal
couple, and I knew it was beautiful, and,
like most American scenery, was not appreciated.
The book was more of a success
than I expected it to be. I attributed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
success to the descriptions of American
scenery and places. I gave it to a family
friend and asked her to mark those parts of
it which she thought real incidents. I was
very much astonished and greatly pleased
to find, when she returned it, that she had
marked some passages which were purely
invention. This made me ask myself if I
might not hope to write a novel some day."</p>

<p>The question was evidently answered in
the affirmative, for after 1872 Mr. Howells's
output of fiction became regular and profuse.
His novels have all been more or less
popular. He is fondest himself of "A
Modern Instance," we are told; and he regards
"A Hazard of New Fortunes" as his
best novel. It may safely be said that the
book which it was the greatest pleasure to
him to write is "Literary Friends and
Acquaintance," published late last year.
Altogether his works number about seventy-five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Mr. Howells is a plodder. "I believe,"
he once said to an interviewer, "in
the inspiration of hard work." As a rule
all successful authors have held this belief.</p>

<p>Mr. Howells resigned from <i>The Atlantic</i>
in 1880 to engage in general literary work.
Six years later he formally transferred his
allegiance from Boston to New York by accepting
charge of "The Editor's Study" in
<i>Harper's</i>. Afterward, for a time, he was
editor of <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>. Late in 1900
he resumed his editorial connection with
<i>Harper's</i>.</p>

<p>Although admired the world over, and
dignified with the title of Doctor of Laws,
which he got from Yale in 1871, Mr.
Howells is hospitable and genial, just as Dr.
Holmes was; and many young writers with
more or less glittering names owe much to
his counsel and his encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2>BRET HARTE<a id="harte"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">B</span></i><span class="smcap">ret Harte</span> has been called the
writer of the best short stories in
the English language. A literary
court of arbitration would doubtless find
that the best of his short stories are without
superiors. It should not be forgotten that
the reading public is still under the magic
spell which Mr. Harte wove more than a
third of a century ago with "The Luck of
Roaring Camp," "Plain Language from
Truthful James," "Tennessee's Partner,"
"Miggles" and the other works which first
called attention to the author's still unquestioned
genius. "The Luck of Roaring
Camp" and "Under the Redwoods" mark
the present extremes of one of the most
romantic chapters in our literary history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Some years ago, when the popular writer
and his wife were spending the summer at
Newport, a woman said confidentially to Mrs.
Harte, "What is your husband's real name?"
It evidently did not seem natural to the
inquirer that an author could always have
borne such a crisp and striking name; and
the same idea, that the name must be simply
a happy pseudonym, has, we believe,
struck many others. The idea is partly
wrong and partly right. Francis Brett
Harte was his name originally. That form
was changed to Francis Bret Harte, then to
F. Bret Harte, and finally to the attractive
form which long ago endeared itself to the
whole English-reading world. For it is
well known, undoubtedly, that the Bret
Harte stories are quite as popular in England
and in the British colonies as in the
United States; that Germany yields to none
in her admiration for them; and that one of
them, "Gabriel Conroy," has been printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in at least fourteen languages. Indeed, a
quarter of a century ago the name of Bret
Harte was as powerful the world over as
was Mr. Kipling's a few years since. Perhaps
the felicitous brevity of the name was
one of the elements of that power.</p>

<p>Bret Harte was born in Albany, N. Y.,
on August 25, 1839. His father was at
that time a teacher in the Albany Female
Seminary. Bret was still in boyhood when
his father died. The boy, who had received
an ordinary public school education, went
to California with his mother in 1854. The
Golden State was then one enormous mining-camp.
The laws were largely unwritten.
A passion either for gold or for adventure
had taken possession of thousands of persons
and thrown them together in one of the
wildest parts of the world. In this exciting
school of life young Harte studied his
first lessons of life. For three years he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thrown hither and thither, with his eyes and
his ears wide open, and with his mind sponging
up the lively incidents which, through
his skillful pen, have since become the idyls
of the pioneer West, with all its vice and
virtue, its heroes and cravens, its showy
wealth and its heart-touching poverty. For
a year he was an express rider, with a route
lying among the ravines and gulches of the
northern part of the State; and what he
had not learned by his own observation he
learned during this period from other observers.
This was the time when Yuba Bill
and the other heroic road-agents took form in
his imagination. At another time he picked
up the trade of compositor in a newspaper
office in Eureka; and at still another time
he went out prospecting, and there was a
sign of later days in the fact that before
the three years of his uncertainty came to an
end he taught school for a short while. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was then that, for the first time, he indulged
the literary instincts awakened by his experience
in the newspaper office in Eureka.
This budding age is outlined in "M'liss."</p>

<p>In 1857 the young man settled down in
San Francisco as a compositor in the office
of the <i>Golden Era</i>, a weekly periodical. A
few round-about-town sketches called "A
Boy's Dog," "Sidewalkings," and "In a
Balcony," submitted most humbly and respectfully
to the editor, brought to the ambitious
printer the reward of an invitation
to join the editorial staff. With the acceptance
of the invitation began a most brilliant
literary career. We are indebted to a friend
of the author's for the statement: "Those
were busy days, and much of the matter
ground out in that time of probation is as
pregnant with genius and wit as any that
he has seen fit to retain in his complete
edition." But the edition is not yet complete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
we may remark.</p>

<p>When, not long afterward, a weekly called
<i>The Californian</i> was established in San
Francisco, the new writer went over to it
enthusiastically. In the columns of this
periodical and of some of the daily papers
appeared the poems and the sketches which
rounded out Mr. Harte's "time of probation."
<i>The Californian</i> was the means of acquainting
him with Mark Twain, also a new figure
on the literary horizon. Indeed, it has been
said by men who knew the little group of
enthusiasts connected with <i>The Californian</i>
that it was Harte who induced the Mississippi
pilot first to put to use his genius as
a humorist.</p>

<p>This catch-penny work of the days of
<i>The Californian</i> was profitable to Harte
simply as experience. Like many another
story-teller, he came to the conclusion that
steady employment, with a few leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hours in the day, would do more to advance
him than anything else, and so he found
work, first in the United States Surveyor
General's office, then with the United
States Marshal, and later in the mint.
Shortly before going to the mint he was
introduced to Easterners by a sketch in <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>, "The Legend of Monte
Diablo," which introduction was due largely
to the patronage of Jessie Benton Fremont,
one of the most cultivated women in California.
His secretaryship at the mint,
which began in 1864, led to a very productive
period, some of the fruits of which are
"John Burns of Gettysburg," "The Pliocene
Skull," "The Society on the Stanislow"
and the remarkable "Condensed
Novels," in the writing of which, as one of
the old-time critics remarked "a new set of
faculties was required."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point naturally comes in the
question, What was Bret Harte's first book?
The question was answered last year by the
author himself, in this statement: "When
I say that my first book was not my own,
and contained beyond the title page not one
word of my own composition, I trust that
I shall not be accused of trifling with paradox,
or tardily unbosoming myself of
plagiary. But the fact remains that in priority
of publication the first book for which
I became responsible, and which probably
provoked more criticism than anything I
have written since, was a small compilation
of California poems indited by other hands.
There was an ominous calm when the
book reached the market. Out of it the
bolt fell. A well-known mining weekly,
which I will poetically veil under the title
of the Red Dog <i>Jay Hawk</i>, was the first
to swoop down upon the tuneful and unsuspecting
quarry as follows: 'The hog wash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and "purp" stuff ladled out from the slop
bucket of Messrs. &mdash;&mdash; and Company, of
'Frisco, by some lop-eared Eastern apprentice
and called "A Compilation of Californian
Verses," might be passed over as far
as criticism goes. A club in the hands of
any able-bodied citizen of Red Dog and a
steamboat ticket to the bay, cheerfully contributed
from this office, would be all
sufficient. But when an imported greenhorn
dares to call his flapdoodle mixture
"Californian," it is an insult to the State
that has produced the gifted Yellow Hammer,
whose lofty flights have from time to
time dazzled our readers in the columns of
the <i>Jay Hawk</i>. That this complacent
editorial jackass, browsing among the dock
and the thistles which he has served up in
this volume, should make allusion to California's
greatest bard, is rather a confession
of idiocy than a slur upon the genius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
our esteemed contributor.'"</p>

<p>There were other bolts quite as forceful,
but as a sample of the literary criticism
found in California in the great mining
days, and also of the reins that kept editorial
enterprise in check, the foregoing will
suffice.</p>

<p>In 1868, while Mr. Harte was still working
in the mint and quietly hitching his
literary wagon to a star, Mr. Roman, an ambitious
San Francisco publisher, projected
<i>The Overland Monthly</i>, a periodical that
has had considerable influence on the literary
growth of the far West. He invited
the secretary of the mint to be its editor.
The invitation was accepted, and the editor-to-be
at once went to work on a story for
the first number, which was to appear in
July. The scheme of the magazine was
thoroughly Eastern, but the editor decided
that, for the honor of the West, his story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
should have a strong local flavor. He called
it "The Luck of Roaring Camp," and, without
a thought of any impropriety, had it
put into type. For the sake of accuracy
we take the liberty of relating the consequences
as they were related in the old
days:</p>

<p>"The first intimation that it was likely
to arouse criticism of any kind, good or bad,
came to him in the form of a protest from
the young woman who read proof on the
paper. She sent word to him that if matter
as indecent as 'The Luck of Roaring Camp'
was to be printed in <i>The Overland Monthly</i>
she could not retain her place as an employee
of the paper. Harte read the story over
again in proof to see where the indecencies
were, but could find none. Then he took
it to the owner of the paper, and asked his
opinion of it. The owner took it home and
read it to his wife. It made her cry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
she thought it was a powerful production,
but she agreed with the proof-reader that it
was too daring in its conception, and too
frank in its details even for the not-over particular
society which inhabited California.
Harte heard her judgment with amazement.
He was utterly unable to see anything improper
in the story. Finally the owner of the
paper so far went over to the side of the story's
critics as to say that he thought the story
would have to be left out. Harte took a
day and a night to think the matter over,
and then he announced his own decision.
He said that if the story was left out of
that month's issue of <i>The Overland Monthly</i>
he would himself insist on being left out of
all connection with the paper in the future.
There was no quarrel. He simply was
certain that his judgment was good, and
felt that if it was considered bad on this
occasion by the owner, he would never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
able to suit him in the future. Finally,
after the matter had been placed on this
definite basis, the owner made up his mind
to let the story run." We have met the
account of the momentous difficulty in a
slightly different form, but the account
which we have repeated may be accepted
as substantially correct.</p>

<p>"The Luck of Roaring Camp" did not
please the Californians, and it seemed for
some time as if the censure of the feminine
critics would be justified popularly; but
when the flattering opinions of the Eastern
readers were reported, the gold hunters
changed their minds. No doubt they were
astonished to hear that a Boston publishing
house, at that time the most powerful
organization of its kind in the land, had
offered to accept anything the author might
offer at his own terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Harte was busy sending provisions to the
snowbound camps in the Sierras in the fall
of 1868, so that his next story, "The Outcasts
of Poker Flat," made its appearance
as late as January, 1869. That same year,
too, "Plain Language from Truthful James,"
popularly known as "The Heathen Chinee,"
came to delight the reading public; and
since that time Bret Harte's fame has remained
more or less brilliant.</p>

<p>For a time he filled the chair of Modern
Literature in the University of California.
In 1871 he came East. The journey was
a triumph. Nothing like it ever occurred
before, or has occurred since. Once in the
East, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> agreed to pay
him one thousand dollars a month for a
poem and a short story; but the author
soon found the agreement irksome. He
lectured and wrote at his leisure in this
country until 1878, when he was appointed
United States Consul at Crefeld, Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and two years later he was sent to Glasgow.
His term there closed in 1885, and ever
since he has made London his home.</p>

<p>However, he has always been Californian
in his stories. His latest offering, "Under
the Redwoods," is as reflective of the growing
days of the West as are early masterpieces
like "Tennessee's Partner" and
"Miggles." His star may be a trifle lower
in the heavens than it was when he went
abroad, but it is still of the first magnitude.</p>

<h2>MARK TWAIN<a id="twain"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">M</span></i><span class="smcap">ark Twain's</span> real name is
Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
There is a story to the effect
that one of his ancestors, by name Gregory
Clement, an adherent of Cromwell, added
his voice to the condemnation of Charles I.
and was beheaded for it by Charles II.
However, it is neither as Clement nor as
Clemens that the most celebrated of contemporaneous
American authors is, or has
been, popularly known, but by the pen-name
of Mark Twain, which he adopted when he
was piloting on the Mississippi, more than
forty years ago.</p>

<p>In fun or in earnest&mdash;it is hard to
fathom his moods&mdash;Mr. Clemens said
lately that he was working on an autobiography
which must not be opened until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
has been in his grave for a century. So
far as the main facts are concerned, however,
the humorist's autobiography is already
an open book. It has been chronicled
piece by piece in a hundred magazines and
in a thousand newspapers since 1868, when
"Innocents Abroad" appeared, up to the
present day. Probably no other living
author has been so beset by the requests of
editors and the importunities of reporters;
and assuredly no other living author has
been more amiable or more liberal in his
responses. No, a good portion of the autobiography
of Mr. Clemens, or Mark Twain,&mdash;we
shall use each name impartially,&mdash;will
be submitted to the public within a
hundred hours after his death&mdash;and may
that inevitable conclusion be far, far off!</p>

<p>As a man and as a writer Mr. Clemens
has invariably carried the colors of the
typical American. A stern sense of duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and of honor, a seldom absent sense of
humor, inexhaustible energy, dauntless
pluck, unfeigned simplicity and abiding
sympathy and fidelity, are the salient characteristics
of the typical American&mdash;of
Mr. Clemens. At the same time, above
and beyond the writer's unexcelled powers
of observation and richness of imagination
is his fine sense of artistry. "Mark Twain's
humor will live forever," Mr. Howells is
reported to have said some years ago, "because
of its artistic qualities. Mark Twain
portrays and interprets real types, not only
with exquisite appreciation and sympathy,
but with a force and truth of drawing that
makes them permanent." So fastidious a
critic as Prof. Barrett Wendell has lately
dwelt on the constant and irresistible charm
of Huckleberry Finn.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens was born in a little Missouri
village named Florida on Nov. 30,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1835. His father, John Marshall Clemens,
of a good Virginia family, was one of the
pioneers who, early in the century, crossed
the Alleghanies and sought new fortunes in
the unsettled West. His mother, whose
maiden name was Elizabeth Lampton, also,
like her husband, came of good English
stock. Her forefathers had plunged into
the wilds with Daniel Boone; and she herself
has been described as "one of those
beautiful, graceful, and vivacious Kentucky
girls who have contributed so much to the
reputation of that fortunate State." A
cousin of Mr. Clemens, by the way, who
was one of the humorist's playmates sixty
years ago, is the Rev. Eugene Joshua Lampton,
who, by some of the people in Missouri,
is called "the Bishop of the diocese."
Elder Lampton is the possessor of the
original subscription list which Mr. Clemens
carried when he was a newspaper boy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Hannibal. But this is reaching ahead a
little.</p>

<p>They say that Mr. Clemens's mother was
not only remarkably winsome but remarkably
intelligent. When the author was a
youngster one of his relatives said of him:
"He's a perfect little human kaleidoscope."
"Yes," added another, "and he gets that
from his mother." Samuel's mother could
"write well," which was no small accomplishment
in the south-west in the thirties.</p>

<p>When Samuel was about nine years old
his father decided to move to Hannibal, in
the same State. The prime cause of this
immigration was the failure of the elder
Clemens to make Salt River navigable;
hence, as one writer has suggested, the probable
origin of the old synonym for disaster,
"gone up Salt River."</p>

<p>Young Clemens was sent to school in
Hannibal. Some of his schoolmates are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
living in the old town to-day. He seems
to have enjoyed the rule of two teachers,
Miss Newcomb and Miss Lucy Davis. Physically,
he was not a strong boy, but intellectually
he seems always to have been
more than a match for any boy of his age.
He had two brothers, Orion, who was considerably
older, and Henry, who was the
youngest of them all. Samuel attended
school until his father died in 1847. The
death of the father, who had just been
elected county judge, was a hard blow to
the family. After the death of his father,
the subject of our sketch went to work for
the local newspaper as a carrier. Afterward
he served as "devil" and type-setter,
and then, having completed his apprenticeship
and thinking to better himself elsewhere,
he set off on foot for the East.
Doing odd jobs at the case and the press,
he finally reached Philadelphia. Thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he went to New York. But the East did
not please him, and at seventeen he was
back in Hannibal.</p>

<p>He was now on his uppers, as the phrase
is, and, in addition to its adventurous side,
the financial side of steamboat life on the
Mississippi magnetized him. There, for
instance, was the pilot, the guide of the great
smoking craft, a man who knew everything
thought worth knowing, a man looked up to
by every merchant, every traveler and every
desperado. Samuel determined to become
a pilot, and the picturesque Capt. Horace
E. Bixby took him under his wing. In his
"Life on the Mississippi" Mark Twain describes
with all his eloquence the interesting
and exciting life of a pilot on the treacherous
river. And was not the pilot's a great
and attractive post for a young man? "If
you will take," says Mark, "the longest
street in New York, and travel up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it, conning its features patiently until you
know every house and window and door and
lamp-post and big and little sign by heart,
and know them so accurately that you can
instantly name the one you are abreast of
when you are set down at random in that
street in the middle of an inky-black night,
you will then have a tolerable notion of the
amount and the exactness of a pilot's knowledge
who carries the Mississippi River in
his head. And then if you will go on until
you know every street-crossing, the character,
size and position of the crossing-stones,
and the varying depth of mud in each
of those numberless places, you will have
some idea of what the pilot must know in
order to keep a Mississippi steamer out of
trouble. Next, if you will take half of the
signs on that long street and <i>change their
places</i> once a month, and still manage to
know their new positions accurately on dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nights, and keep up with these repeated
changes without making any mistakes, you
will understand what is required of a pilot's
peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi."</p>

<p>The life on the river, with its ever-changing
dramatic and entertaining incidents,
awoke the young man's sleeping imagination&mdash;gave
him a strong desire to put to use
the modest literary methods which he
had acquired as an itinerant printer. Mr.
Howells, too, it will be noticed, first had
the passion for authorship aroused in him
by the types and the presses.</p>

<p>The first sketches which Mr. Clemens
sent to the local papers were signed "Iosh,"
a meaningless signature, which quickly made
the young author desire something better.
The improvement came to him when one
day he heard a "big black negro" who was
taking soundings call out "Mark twain!"
which meant that there were two fathoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of water. The call struck the pilot's fancy,
and he kept it in mind for future use.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens served in the pilot-house&mdash;one
of the best school-houses in the world,
it may be said&mdash;until the war broke out.
Then he ran blockades for a while, and for
two weeks he carried a gun in the Confederate
army, under General Harris. The
two weeks' service cooled his ardor, and he
went farther west with his brother Orion,
who, as a sympathizer with the Union side,
had received an appointment as Secretary of
the Territory of Nevada. Samuel was to
act as his brother's secretary, but as in this
office he did nothing and earned nothing,
he, after an attempt at prospecting, joined
the staff of the <i>Virginia City Enterprise</i>.
It was as the <i>Enterprise's</i> correspondent at
the capital of the Territory, Carson City,
that Mr. Clemens first used the striking
pseudonym "Mark Twain." But he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
no taste for routine work; or, rather, his
manner of garnishing, often with his stinging
satire, his routine work, did not suit the
taste of the editor of the <i>Enterprise</i>, and at
the end of six months Mark Twain stamped
the dust of Nevada from his shoes and struck
out for California, where he readily secured
employment on the <i>Union</i>. In the spring
of 1865 he took an interest with Bret Harte
in a short-lived weekly called <i>The Californian</i>,
and some of the humorous articles
which he wrote for that publication were
widely copied in the East. Later the <i>Union</i>
sent him to the Hawaiian Islands to describe
the sugar industry. His work as a correspondent
was very successful, and so was the
lecture tour which he made in California
when he returned.</p>

<p>Major Pond, by the way, relates that
Mark Twain committed his lecture to memory
and was entirely confident of success;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
still, desiring to forestall even the possibility
of failure, he arranged with some friend of
his&mdash;Major Pond has forgotten her name&mdash;to
sit in a box and start the applause if
he should look in her direction and stroke
his mustache. "Instead of failing, however,"
the Major reports, "the lecture
started propitiously, and that caused Mark
to forget his instructions to the lady. By
and by, unconsciously, when the audience
was filled to the neck with pleasure and sore
with laughter, he unwittingly turned to
the box where his friend sat and pulled
his mustache. At the time he was saying
nothing particularly good or funny, but the
anxious lady took his action for the signal,
and almost broke her fan on the edge of the
box in a fury of applause." It took all
the nerve which Mark had accumulated
among the gamblers and crevasses of the
Mississippi to pass through the embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1867 Mr. Clemens published his first
book, "The Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County, and Other Sketches," of which
about four thousand copies were sold. That
same year he went to Europe with the
excursionists aboard the Quaker City.</p>

<p>This excursion proved to be the turning
point in his career. He had a commission
to write sketches of the journey for the
<i>Alta Californian</i>. The sketches were duly
published, and were then collected and
offered to a publisher for marketing in book
form. The material did not appeal to the
publisher; it was startlingly uncut and
undried. But Mark was insistent, and by
and by the book appeared under the title
of "Innocents Abroad." That book established
Mark Twain's reputation as a humorist.
During the thirty-three years which
have intervened between that day and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
present, Mark Twain's reputation has been
maintained at a matchless height. No one
has been deemed worthy by the reading
public&mdash;which, after all, is the Supreme
Court in literary matters&mdash;to be called
his rival. And since the publication of
"Innocents Abroad" Mark Twain's career
has been public property, with no signs,
no fences, not even a dog therein to bark
at night.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's career stands unequalled
in the literary history of America. He has
been honored as an author and as a lecturer
in almost every part of the world. He made
a fortune and lost it; and now he is making
another.</p>

<p>The literary historian must record in
his case the prodigious achievement of an
author remaining for at least thirty-three
years&mdash;and who knows how many more
will follow?&mdash;in almost steady demand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
print and on the platform.</p>

<p>But in more than a literary sense was
that excursion to Europe on the Quaker
City the turning-point in Mark Twain's
career, for it was on that memorable journey
that he met Miss Olivia L. Langdon of
Elmira, N. Y., who afterward became his
wife; who is the subject of the most eloquent
words which he ever penned, and
who, if we are to believe their long-termed
friend, Major Pond, "makes his works so
great."</p>

<h2>"LEW" WALLACE<a id="wallace"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">G</span></i><span class="smcap">en. "Lew" Wallace</span> is the
author of the most popular story
ever written by an American.
"Ben Hur" has been translated into every
language which can boast of a literature. In
the summer of 1900 it was estimated that
nine hundred thousand copies of the book
had been sold. It is safe to say that by this
time the million mark has been reached.
This literary phenomenon is enlarged by
the fact that "Ben-Hur" has never appeared
in a cheap, that is, a paper-covered, edition.
The General has been urged repeatedly to
authorize the publication of such an edition,
but his refusal has been firm from the first.
A friend of his who once heard the author
repeat his refusal, exclaimed: "Good for
you!" It is a question whether this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
friendly enthusiasm served any high purpose.
If, as has often been reported, "Ben
Hur" has converted many readers to Christianity,
then its circulation might well be
furthered in every way possible.</p>

<p>We mention this circumstance because of
the half-sacred nature which, not simply in
the minds of emotional readers but also in
the mind of the stern-charactered author
himself, the book has been gradually assuming.
A few years ago General Wallace,
while on a lecture tour among the big
cities, related how "Ben Hur" was conceived
and brought forth. He frankly
admitted that prior to its conception, his
religious views were unstable. But as the
ideas took hold of him, as chapter followed
chapter, as the central figure emerged under
his pen from the mist of the early years in
Bethlehem into the divine glow of the later
years around Jerusalem, his own life underwent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
changes, until at length, when the
work was done, he stepped forth a militant
Christian for the first time in his life. We
have heard many authors describe the manner
in which their books were born, but
Lew Wallace's description of the birth of
"Ben Hur," for impressiveness and for
entertainment, stands alone.</p>

<p>If the General had done nothing else but
write the tale of Christ his fame would be
certain of outlasting generations. But, as
a matter of fact, the wonderful book represents
only one of his many qualifications to
sit among the Immortals, as we shall see
presently.</p>

<p>The author was born in Brookville, Ind.,
on April 10, 1827. His father was David
Wallace, who, after graduation from West
Point and a two years' service in the army,
adopted the profession of law and went to
live in the little Indiana town. Six years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
after Lewis was born his father was elected
lieutenant governor by the Whigs, and
three years later he was elected governor.
From 1841 to 1843 Governor Wallace represented
his district in Congress. His
political career was brought to a close
simply, it is said, because he voted for an
appropriation to assist Professor Morse to
establish telegraph communication between
Baltimore and Washington. Lewis's mother
was Esther Test, a daughter of a well-known
Indiana judge, who is described as a woman
of marked beauty and culture, and to
whom may be traced the son's artistic and
literary genius. She died in 1837, but her
children were fortunate to be reared and
trained by a woman of extraordinarily strong
character, Zerelda Saunders, the daughter
of an Indianapolis doctor, who, when she
had devotedly completed her performance
of the none too attractive duties of a stepmother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
worked for the causes of temperance
and equal suffrage, according to a woman
who knew her well, with "eloquence,
dignity, enthusiasm and conscientiousness."</p>

<p>General Wallace avoided school. Thus
he missed the basis which erudition demands,
but he at least improved his passion
for art and for literature. What he enjoyed
most was to stroll out of town to the wild-grown
fields and woods, and there he would
read his favorite books and study nature.
Not one of our authors knows nature more
intimately. In fact, in those juvenile days
he thought seriously of becoming an artist;
and though, if the thought had ever been
realized, literature would have lost much,
still art might have gained in equal proportion.
For at the General's home in Crawfordsville
are some excellent examples of
his skill with the brush. One of his notable
pictures represents the conspirators concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the assassination of President
Lincoln. Another equally remarkable work
of art is his portrait of the Sultan of Turkey.
Many of the General's friends have
valuable samples of his artistic genius.</p>

<p>We mention these facts to show that there
was once good ground for the author's ambition
to be an artist. Yet at the age of
eighteen, just when one would expect such
a talent to exert itself irresistibly, young
Wallace enlisted to fight against Mexico.
He was made a second lieutenant and ordered
to guard the stores at the mouth of the Rio
Grande. In Mexico he found the material
for "The Fair God," his first novel, on which
he worked occasionally for twenty years.
At the end of the Mexican war he returned
to Indiana to study law, in which respect,
it will be noticed, he followed in the footsteps
of his father. Three years after his
admission to the bar he married Susan Elston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of Crawfordsville, herself of no mean literary
gifts, as her three collections of charming
sketches, "The Land of the Pueblos," "The
Storied Sea," and "The Repose in Egypt,"
attest. The Wallaces lived in Crawfordsville
until the outbreak of the War of the Rebellion.
Thereupon the young lawyer went
straight to Indianapolis and offered his services
to the governor. For a while he
served as adjutant-general. Then he took
the colonelcy of a regiment of zouaves, and
with such vigor and success that early in
September, 1861, he was brevetted brigadier-general.
For gallantry at Fort Donelson
he was afterwards brevetted major-general.
At the close of the war he was one of the
most distinguished soldiers in the land. As
a recognition of his great services&mdash;in July,
1864, according to Secretary Stanton and
General Grant, he had saved Washington
from destruction&mdash;he was appointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the commission which tried the assassins of
Lincoln. That duty done, he returned to
Crawfordsville.</p>

<p>This return home signalized the real beginning
of his literary career. He was now
not far from forty years of age, and he was
not content to live on his military reputation.
Law had little power over him. So
he turned to the manuscript which had been
growing slowly for many years; and 1873
saw the publication of "The Fair God,"
the souvenir of the author's service in the
Mexican war. Compared with the average
romance, "The Fair God" possesses exceptional
power and originality. "Ben-Hur"
appeared in 1880; but it must not be supposed
that General Wallace gave this second
book his exclusive attention for the seven
years that had passed. It was half written
when, in 1878, President Hayes appointed
the distinguished Indianian Governor of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Mexico. The visitor at the Wallace homestead
in Crawfordsville will be shown the
beech tree in the shade of which the work
was done. To the way in which he works
we shall turn later. The concluding half of
the tale was written at spare moments in
the governor's palace in Santa Fé, which
Mrs. Wallace has described as "the last
rallying-place of the Pueblo Indians."</p>

<p>At first the more captious of the critics
accented their discovery that "Ben-Hur"
showed no rhetorical improvement over
"The Fair God"; and, though they were
right, they erred sadly in trying to measure
the book with narrow rules. It has defects,
as the most sympathetic critic must admit;
but the impartial critic must also admit
that in boldness and grandeur of conception
and in vigor and beauty of style, the story
stands unequalled in American literature,
and, in parts, unexcelled in the romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
literature of any nation. Here and there
are unbalanced sentences, graceless phrases,
misplaced words, and interpolations that
detract from the unity of effect desirable in
all works of art; but here and there, too,
especially in the chapters descriptive of the
Grove of Daphne and of the chariot race, is
a vivid power at once more charming and
more thrilling than anything to be found in
any other English novel. "A great historical
romance," as one of our critics remarked
many years ago, "is not to be made with
reference to the square and the compass.
It must be a vivid historical impression, and
at the same time a wisely considered story
of life." "Ben-Hur" adequately fulfills these
two fundamental conditions. Moreover it
perfectly fulfills, delicately yet impressively,
the great moral purpose which the author
imposed upon himself. As we recall the
author's narrative of the writing of the tale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this moral purpose, beginning gently, gradually
acquired a force that mastered him
completely. It was like a flood that first
trickles through the seam in the dam, and
then, gathering in volume, sweeps all before
it. The characters themselves, from Christ
to the faithful steward, display the highest
flight of imagination to be found in any
American novel. Indeed, many of the landscape
features themselves are so wonderfully
vivid that the same praise awarded Tom
Moore for his imaginative descriptions of
the East may judiciously be extended to
General Wallace. We have heard the General
say that a scene which he had regarded
as purely fictitious or imaginative appeared
in surprising reality when, years after the
book was published, he first visited Palestine.</p>

<p>Of the tremendous sensation which "Ben-Hur"
made when it appeared, and of the
phenomenal success which it has maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
even down to the present time, it is, we
presume, unnecessary to speak. The author,
as we noted before, has guarded its fame
diligently, jealously; in fact, although
Lawrence Barrett urged him years ago to
allow the book to be dramatized, he did not
yield to solicitation in this form until 1900.
This circumstance reminds us that the
General once wrote a play called "Commodus,"
but its multiplicity of leading characters
has kept it in his desk. It would
bankrupt any manager in America, they
told him. "The Prince of India," the romance
published in 1893, suffered, as it
must have suffered, by comparison with
"Ben-Hur." Judged by itself, it is delightful.
It exemplifies the writer's remarkable
creative force and his ever-youthful enthusiasm.
Probably the last notable work
from the General's pen will be the autobiography
on which he has been at work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for the last few years.</p>

<p>General Wallace's diplomatic experience
at Constantinople is worthy of a chapter,
but we must content ourselves with saying
that it added brilliancy to the honors which
he had earned as a soldier and as an author.
Of late the General has been living a semi-pastoral
life at his estate in Indiana. He
has himself described his daily habits:</p>

<p>"I begin to write at about 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Keep
at work till noon. Resume about 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
and leave my studio about 4. I then exercise
for two hours. I walk or ride horseback,
according to the weather. When it
rains I put on a heavy pair of boots and
trudge five to seven miles across the country.
I usually ride about a dozen miles.
To this habit of taking regular exercise I
attribute my good health. I eat just what
I want and as much as I want. When
night comes I lie down and sleep like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
child, never once waking until morning. I
usually retire at 9.30 and rise at 7.30, aiming
to secure nine hours' sleep. I smoke
at pleasure, a pipe or a cigar, but never a
cigarette, which I consider the deadliest
thing a person can put in his mouth. The
amount of work I produce in a day varies
greatly. Sometimes I write four hundred
and sometimes twelve hundred words.
What I write to-day in the rough, to-morrow
I revise, perhaps reducing it to twenty
words, perhaps striking out all the day's
work and beginning at the same point once
more. That constitutes my second copy.
When proofs come from the publisher
another revision takes place. It consists
chiefly of condensation and expurgation."</p>

<p>He was asked once what he considered
the secret of his success. "Work," he
answered, "and, as an author, the doing it
myself with my own hand, not by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a typewriter, or amanuensis or stenographer.
To work I would add universal
reading."</p>

<p>"Who is your favorite novelist?" the
questioner went on.</p>

<p>"Sir Walter Scott."</p>

<p>"What is your favorite novel?"</p>

<p>"'Ivanhoe.'"</p>

<p>"And your favorite poem?"</p>

<p>"'Idylls of the King.'"</p>

<p>"What do you consider the sublimest
poetry in the world?"</p>

<p>"You will find it in the Psalms and Job,
in Homer, in Milton and in Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Who, in your judgment, are the three
greatest warriors the world has produced?"</p>

<p>"Alexander, Cæsar, Napoleon."</p>

<p>"Who, in your opinion, were the greatest
American statesmen?"</p>

<p>"George Washington, Alexander Hamilton,
and James Madison. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Hamilton is, in my judgment, the father of
the American Constitution. But that Constitution
would never have been adopted
save for the support given it by the great
name of George Washington."</p>

<p>We have said, after all, far too little
of this distinguished man, but all that we
might say would hardly give the right emphasis
to the greatness of his manifold
deeds and to the charm of his personal
character.</p>

<h2>GEORGE W. CABLE<a id="cable"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">D</span></i><span class="smcap">uring</span> his visit to this country a
few years ago Mr. J. M. Barrie
said to the students at Smith
College that no American novelist merits
a higher rank than Mr. George W. Cable.
True as, in the abstract, this foreign estimate
of Mr. Cable's worth is, it would
awaken a rather feeble echo among the
devourers of our colonial literature. Yet one
of the Southerner's characteristic stories,
"The Grandissimes," for instance, or "Posson
Jone," or "Madame Delphine," is
deserving of a recommendation to the liveliest
admirer of eighteenth century heroes
and heroines.</p>

<p>At bottom, there is much in common between
Mr. Barrie and Mr. Cable, and this
circumstance may account for the Scotchman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
enthusiastic utterance at Smith College.
Each has a poetical love for nature;
each has portrayed a picturesque corner of
the world with the kindest intention, the
broadest sympathy and the choicest skill;
each has been the object of misunderstanding
at home and of warm admiration abroad,
and each has led where others may only
follow. It is perfectly natural that two
such lovable and loving men should clasp
hands across the sea.</p>

<p>We must admit that the writer who has
pictured New Orleans as vividly as Balzac
pictured his beloved Paris was better known,
say, ten years ago, than he is to-day. Then
he had fewer distractions than he has to-day.
Then he had reached the climax of his literary
productivity. Then he was personally
endearing himself to his fellow-countrymen
with his inimitably delightful recitations
and songs. There have been authors who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
drew larger audiences, and who, to use a
homely phrase, made more noise on their
tours, but there has never been an author
whose readings from his works gave sweeter
pleasure; and, as for his manner of singing
the Creole folksongs, it was indescribably
charming. Mr. John Fox, Jr., is the only
other American author who has ventured to
sing folk-songs publicly; and we may say,
without fear of suggesting the odious comparison,
that the younger man has been
very successful, too.</p>

<p>"Many years ago," Mr. Cable once said,
"when I discovered that these folk-songs of
the slaves of former Louisiana Creoles had
a great charm of their own and were preserved
by tradition only, I was induced to
gather them and reduce them to notation.
I found that others were so strongly interested
in the songs that, without pretending
to any musical authority or original charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of voice, I was tempted to sing one or two
of them before public audiences. The first
time I did so was in Boston, and since then
I have rarely been allowed to leave them
out of my entertainment, when the length
of my literary program left room for them."</p>

<p>But we must look back farther. To start
at the very beginning, George Washington
Cable was born in New Orleans on October
12, 1844. His father was of Virginian descent;
his mother of New England. They
were married in Indiana ten years before
George was born, and they moved to New
Orleans after the hard times of 1837. The
father died in 1859, and then George, at
the age of fifteen, went to work to help support
the family. He was a very small boy
for his age; and indeed it is related that in
1863, when the family was sent outside the
Union lines for refusing to take the oath of
allegiance, his sisters had no difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
obtaining permission to have their "little
brother" accompany them. The "little
brother," however, was not so harmless as
he looked. He volunteered to fight for the
Confederacy, and was mustered into the
Fourth Mississippi Cavalry, then in Gen.
Wirt Adams's brigade. For a time after
the war he rolled cotton on the New Orleans
levees and carried a surveyor's chain along
the banks of the Atchafalaya; and by and
by he found a place on the <i>New Orleans
Picayune</i>. He is therefore to be counted
among the authors whose literary career
started in the reporter's room. His strong
taste for culture and his zeal for the public
welfare soon made an outlet for themselves
in short articles touching on current topics;
and, though the articles were much enjoyed
by the readers of the <i>Picayune</i>, the young
writer before long felt the distaste for newspaper
work which, early or late, comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
almost every journalist with high literary
aims. Journalism is the best school of experience
in the world, but it can be attended
too long.</p>

<p>Cable resisted the fascinations of journalism
firmly and wisely. At the height of
his success he left the <i>Picayune</i> and went
into the counting-room of a cotton house.
He had a good eye for the picturesque features
of daily life, the features met commonly
in the daily papers, and at his leisure
he wrote a few short stories based on
New Orleans characters. One day these
stories, which he had made no attempt to sell,
came into the hands of an agent of the old
<i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, who happened to visit
Louisiana in connection with the well-remembered
Great South papers. This agent,
by name Edward King, praised the stories,
and, at the author's request, sent one of
them to New York. The story, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
reason, came back; but the next one sent,
"Sieur George," brought a note of acceptance
and encouragement from Richard
Watson Gilder, Doctor Holland's associate.</p>

<p>A few years later a volume of these Louisiana
sketches was published under the title
of "Old Creole Days." It was immediately
recognized as a notable addition to our short
story literature. Nevertheless, the author
stuck to his desk in the counting-room. Many
another ambitious young writer, in the circumstances,
would have given up his position
and leaned entirely upon his pen. Young
Cable had a cool head. He knew that he
was moving forward handsomely, and that
if he yielded to the excitement of the situation
for a moment he might fall back. So
his pen rusted for two years, when he accepted
an order for a serial story. This
turned out to be "The Grandissimes," a
clear and entertaining exposition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
author's views of the old-fashioned Southern
life, a happy mingling of fact and fiction,
of fun and sobriety, of calm appreciation of
the Louisiana aristocracy and a warm toleration
of the struggles of the poor negro
slaves. Of course, this attitude added nothing
to the author's popularity among Southerners.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, a Southern woman,
who happened to visit Northampton, where
of late Mr. Cable has made his home, was
asked if she ever read his stories. "Of course
not," she indignantly answered; "I wouldn't
think of looking at them." However,
she was persuaded to look at them after a
while; and it is a peculiar tribute to their
delicate yet powerful charm that the woman
expressed regret that she had misconceived
his work and opposed his ideas.</p>

<p>"The Grandissimes" was so successful
that the publishers are said to have sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
author a check for five hundred dollars more
than the contract price. This first long tale
was followed by another much the same in
vein and in atmosphere, "Madame Delphine,"
which is the story-teller's own favorite.
The subject and the style are equally
delightful.</p>

<p>In 1879, when Mr. Cable was thirty-five
years old, the business house in which he
had worked to keep his feet on earth dissolved,
and the clerk had to choose between
returning to journalism and devoting himself
entirely to literature. By this time he
seems to have been more self-reliant and
more confident. At any rate, he chose literature.
The first thing he did was to decline
to write for more than one publisher. It
must be said again that a steadier head never
produced a story.</p>

<p>A strong sense of duty, in fact, early established
control of his work. His interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
were not permitted to grow narrow. He
realized that he possessed exceptionally
abundant resources for the production of
miscellaneous literature touching on the
development of the middle South, and he
determined to make the most of his possessions.
In 1880, for example, we find him
engaged in a special article on New Orleans
for the Census Bureau, and his native city
was also the theme of an article which he
wrote for the "Encyclopedia Britannica."
One of his critics has said: "Since Hawthorne's
Custom House reports, few pages of
the Government documents have been enriched
by so discriminating a pen as in the
exhaustive census monograph upon the past
and present of the Southern metropolis."
This paper led to a series of articles entitled
"The Creoles of Louisiana," written for <i>The
Century</i>, in which the reader will note an
artistic combination of dry history and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
vivid imagination.</p>

<p>That such a painstaking, conscientious, dutiful
writer should ever be charged with falling
into an anachronism may seem preposterous;
but although the charge has been made,
we find no instance in which it has been sustained.
A writer who once visited him
brushed the charge aside vigorously: "Mr.
Cable's plan of work," he said, "is unusually
methodical, for his counting-room training
has stood him in good stead. All his notes and
references are carefully indexed and journalled,
and so systematized that he can turn,
without a moment's delay, to any authority
he wishes to consult. In this respect, as in
many others, he has not, perhaps, his equal
among living authors. In making his notes,
it is his usual custom to write in pencil on
scraps of paper. These notes are next put
into shape, still in pencil, and the third
copy, intended for the press, is written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ink on note-paper&mdash;the chirography exceedingly
neat, delicate and legible. He is
always exact, and is untiring in his researches....
Before attempting to write
upon any historical point, he gathers together
all available material without reckoning
time or trouble; and, under such
conditions, nothing is more unlikely than
that he should be guilty of error."</p>

<p>The business life which fortunately imposed
so valuable a system upon him incidentally
inspired his second novel, "Dr.
Sevier," many of the scenes in which are
faithful pictures of his own experiences as
a youth. As in the historical sketches, so
in this second novel the poetic imagination
of the author fairly rivals his grasp of the
prosaic relations existing between man and
man. But such relations were supremely
vital from his viewpoint, and his third novel,
"Bonaventure," was written in moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
stolen from the discussion of the questions
of elections, prison systems, and the future
of the negro. The reader will note in the
hero of this story the personification of the
practical strengthening and yet spiritualizing
gospel which the author has enunciated
in his private and public religious work.
For it is important to chronicle that Mr.
Cable has done as much to Christianize several
communities as the most energetic minister
would be expected to do; and from his
scrupulous performance of not merely the
ordinary Christian duties but also of duties
self-imposed, he has never allowed literature
or society to beguile him.</p>

<p>Naturally his social and political studies
drew many invitations to address public
meetings. It was at Johns Hopkins University,
while lecturing on literary art, that,
upon the suggestion of President Gilman,
he ventured for the first time to read selections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from his own stories. The delight of
the audience was no less a surprise to him
than the realization of his own elocutionary
skill. This he set about to cultivate, and
with such success that for years afterward
he was enthusiastically welcomed to the
great cities. It was once estimated that
in his busiest years on the platform he
traveled more than ten thousand miles every
twelve months.</p>

<p>For various reasons, particularly that he
might be able to write of the South impartially
and that he might be nearer the literary
market, he moved to Simsbury, Conn.,
in 1884, and the next year to Northampton,
Mass., where he has lived ever since. But
he has never lost sight of his native concern
in the progress of the South; and as for his
philanthropy, in Northampton it has spread
wider and wider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>There, on the edge of one of the quietest
and loveliest towns in Massachusetts, he has
had built for himself a home suited to all his
excellent tastes, and there he lives, intent
always on making someone happy, and writing
simply enough to maintain the brilliancy
and popularity of his name.</p>

<h2>HENRY JAMES<a id="james"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">H</span></i><span class="smcap">enry James</span> has been at
pains, lately, to put a stop to a
report that he proposes to return
to America, yet by descent and at heart he
is undoubtedly as loyal an American as his
neighbor in England, Bret Harte. Even
a cosmopolite may be patriotic.</p>

<p>Mr. James has been called the first
American cosmopolitan author. It is an unusually
interesting fact that, like Mr. Harte,
who also lives in England, James was born
in Albany, N. Y., the date of his birth being
April 15, 1843. His grandfather, William
James, who made a fortune in the Syracuse
salt works, had settled in Albany soon after
his immigration from Ireland. His millions
were divided among eleven children, one of
whom was Henry James, Sr., the novelist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
father. This branch of the James family
moved to Germany when our author was a
boy; and there he and his brothers and
sister were educated for some years. It used to
be said that, like his distinguished contemporaries,
Howells and Aldrich, James never enjoyed
the advantages of a college education;
but it is a fact, nevertheless, that the James
children were thoroughly educated. Henry
James, Sr., intellectually, was a remarkable
man, and Miss Walsh of New York, whom
he married, has been described as "his complement
in the possession of sterling practical
qualities and the sustaining common sense
of woman." Besides, there were the educational
advantages of travel which the James
children enjoyed. When the Jameses returned
to this country they settled in Cambridge.
It was there that Howells made the
acquaintance of the elder James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>We are tempted to quote extensively
from Howells's memories of Henry James,
Sr., but we shall confine our quotation to a
single paragraph:</p>

<p>"At all times he thought originally in
words of delightful originality, which painted
a fact with the greatest vividness. Of a
person who had a nervous twitching of the
face, and who wished to call up a friend to
them, he said: 'He <i>spasmed</i> to the fellow
across the room, and introduced him.' His
written style had traits of the same adventurousness,
but it was his speech which was
most captivating. As I write of him I see
him before me: his white bearded face,
with a kindly intensity which at first glance
seemed fierce, the mouth humorously shaping
the mustache, the eyes vague behind
the glasses; his sensitive hand gripping the
stick on which he rested his weight to ease
it from the artificial limb he wore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry James, Jr., is one of five children.
Equally as celebrated as Henry, both at
home and abroad, is William James, a professor
at Harvard. In March, 1865, a month
before his twenty-second year, Henry James
made his first appearance in literature with
a contribution to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, entitled
"A Story of a Year," which naturally
had to do with the War of the Rebellion.
It was <i>The Atlantic</i> which also published his
first serial story, "Poor Richard," which
ran through three numbers. Later followed
"Gabrielle de Bergerac" and "Watch and
Ward," each a little more ambitious than
its predecessors; and finally came his first
long story, "Roderick Hudson," which
lasted through twelve numbers of <i>The
Atlantic</i>. The stories aroused a great deal
of comment, most of which was favorable.
This encouraged him to abandon all thought
of law, which he had studied at Harvard,
and make literature his profession. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the same time he went to England, where
he has since spent most of his time.</p>

<p>Like Harte, James has suffered from the
charge of expatriation. The very fact that
the English reading public, which is a most
discerning public, was quick to appreciate
the rare quality of James's style has been
sufficient to keep some American critics in
bad temper&mdash;as if the mere matter of residence
has any intimate connection with
literature! If James were an utter snob,
if he slurred Americans or disclaimed any
acquaintance with them, if his cynicism
were not well founded, or if his satire were
simply burlesque, he might justly be attacked;
but as, personally, he is gentle and
unassuming, as his cynicism is not a mania,
and as his satire is more or less truthful,
the belligerent critics have been largely
wasting their ammunition. Probably no
story of his has ever stirred up bitterer talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
than "Daisy Miller," with its unconventional
American heroine; yet it was only
justice, not to mention literary acumen,
which prompted so spirited an American as
Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, in his
"Short Studies of American Authors,"
to say of the author of "Daisy Miller" that
"he has achieved no greater triumph than
when, in this last-named book, he succeeds
in holding our sympathy and even affection,
after all, for the essential innocence
and rectitude of the poor wayward girl
whose follies he has so mercilessly portrayed."
It is a singular commentary on
the injustice of the denouncers of "Daisy
Miller" that the young lady of Boston
whom gossip made the original of the story
was "cut" by society.</p>

<p>His friends and enemies were still further
divided by "The American" and "The
Portrait of a Lady," and we suspect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the author was poking a little fun at the
hostile camp when he had the American
woman journalist in the latter story say, "I
was going to bring in your cousin&mdash;the
alienated American. There is a great
demand now for the alienated American,
and your cousin is a beautiful specimen. I
should have handled him severely."</p>

<p>Mr. James's friends say that he went to
England, originally, for the benefit of his
health. It cannot be gainsaid that he has
a temperament which makes itself at home
in all lands. He is, indeed, as much a
citizen of Paris as of London, and his
stories in French have been warmly praised
by French critics. But it may be that,
after all, he saw the wisdom of writing
reminiscently, of writing at a distance from
his subjects. Mr. Cable, for example, saw
it when he moved North from New Orleans;
and, furthermore, we know that many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
an author has been condemned unjustly for
telling the truth. The great novelist is not
the idealist, with his world of prize-baby
angels and impossible saints; he is a photographer,
and his mind and his hand are a
camera that cannot lie. Mr. Warner once
said that the object of the novel is to entertain;
Mr. James has said that it is to
represent life. James Lane Allen, we
remember, joined the two statements thus:
"The object of the novel is to entertain by
representing life."</p>

<p>James's reach is transatlantic. Americans
and Britons alike share prominence in
his works. Then, too, of late, his characters
have grown more and more ethereal
and ghostly; they have such faint connection
with the world of chalk-cliffs and
prairies that the question of their citizenship
is insignificant. Physically they appear
to us only in episodes; intellectually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
they are universal types. But, really, the
last word on Henry James's art was said
long ago by <i>The Spectator</i>:</p>

<p>"Mr. Henry James is certainly a very
remarkable illustration of the tendency of
our age to subdivide, in the finest way, the
already rather extreme division of labor,
till a very high perfection is attained in
producing articles of the most curiously
specialized kind, though apparently without
the power of producing anything outside
that kind. For a long time we have had
novelists who are wonderfully skillful in a
particular form of novels, but who seem
unable to master more than one form for
themselves. But Mr. Henry James, though
he has attained a very great perfection in
his own line, seems not to aim at anything
quite so considerable as a story of human
life of any sort. He eschews a story.
What he loves is an episode, i. e., something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which by the nature of the case is
rather a fragment cut out of life, and <i>not</i> a
fair or average specimen of it, nor even such
a part of it as would give you the best
essence of the whole,&mdash;but rather an eddy
in it, which takes you for an interval out
of its main current, and only ends as you
get back into the main current again, or at
least at the point at which you might get
back into the main current again, if some
event (accidental, in relation to the art of
the story) did not occur to cut off abruptly
the thread of the narrative.... One might
perhaps say that Mr. Henry James has
discerned in relation to literature what has
long been known in relation to art&mdash;that
with artists of any genius, 'sketches' are
apt to be more satisfying than finished
pictures. But then the sketches we like
so much in artists' studios are, though unfinished
pictures, still pictures of what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
painter has been most struck with, pictures
in which he has given all that struck him
most, and left only what did not strike him
to be filled in by the fancy of the public.
Now, Mr. Henry James does not give us
sketches of the most striking features in
what he sees of human life and passion, so
much as finished pictures of the little nooks
and bays into which human caprice occasionally
drifts, when the main current of
life's deeper interests has left us for a
moment on one side, and rushed past us....
Mr. Henry James is not so much a novelist
as an episodist, if such a term be
allowable. But he is a wonderful episodist."</p>

<p>All in all, that is the keenest and fairest
criticism of James's works ever written. It
should be taken with every one of his
stories, just as soda is taken with brandy.
Such a criticism is not fugacious; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
complementary.</p>

<p>It brings to mind the amusing criticism
of "The Sacred Fount," notably
Carolyn Wells's "Verbarium Tremens,"
published in <i>The Critic</i>, with its bright
termination&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mad gush of "The Sacred Fount" is ringing in my ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its dictional excitements are obsessing me, I fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For its subtle fascination makes me read it, then, alack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I find I have the James-james, a very bad attack!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>James is an exceedingly neat man, and
this side of him at once strikes every visitor
to his home. The only known exception
to this characteristic neatness is his
handwriting, which is said to be as vexatious
as Horace Greeley's was. "I have a
letter from him before me now," says one of
his correspondents. "The signature I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
know to be 'Henry James.' You might
take it for Henryk Sienkiewicz."</p>

<p>The same correspondent relates a story
which throws a new light on his personality:</p>

<p>"You will be astonished, possibly, to
know that his income from his writing is
a scant three hundred pounds a year,
though in spite of this there has never
come a man in need to Henry James to
whom he has not offered a part of what he
calls his own.</p>

<p>"Not so long ago a novelist in England
died. He left two little children, absolutely
alone in the world. One of that
man's friends put by a little sum for them,
and, out of the kindness of his heart, wrote
to other literary men soliciting their help.
He sought a maker of books who lives in a
castle ... whom he knew to have an
income of over twenty thousand pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from his literary work.</p>

<p>"'Won't you aid these little folk?' he
asked. Not a cent was forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Henry James was written in the matter.
By return mail came a check for fifty
pounds, one-tenth of his whole year's
income."</p>

<p>We have been informed that this estimate
of Mr. James's income is rather small;
but, even if his income be as large as that
of the "maker of books who lives in a
castle," the fact remains that Mr. James
proved his generosity handsomely.</p>

<p>James has acquired his extraordinarily
brilliant style at the expense of incessant
and determined effort. The dazzling spontaneities
are really the product of toilsome
hours. He works mostly in the morning,
writing slowly, and his stories are written
again and again before they go off to his
publisher's. With him writing is a profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a task; he is not the child of
moods. Occasionally he visits friends&mdash;old
friends, like Marion Crawford&mdash;but
the greater part of the year he spends
quietly and almost reclusely in England.</p>

<h2>FRANCIS RICHARD STOCKTON<a id="stockton"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i><span class="smcap">t</span> a dinner given in honor of Mr.
Frank R. Stockton by the Authors'
Club of New York, early in the
year 1901, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, the
editor of <i>The Century</i>, said: "A young
man once came to me and said he would
like to contribute to the magazine every
month. I asked him what he wanted to
write. 'Oh,' he said, 'I'd like to send
you each month a story like The Lady
or the Tiger?'" Mr. Gilder said at the
end of his speech: "When I think of the
immense amount of pleasure Mr. Stockton
brought into the life of Stevenson it seems
to me that alone would be to him a benediction
forever."</p>

<p>The editor of <i>The Century</i> thus happily
illustrated the attitude of the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
world toward Mr. Stockton: on one side
is an eager desire to emulate him, and on
the other an equally eager desire to go to
him for pleasure or for comfort. There is
a natural grace about his stories which
has often deceived the inexpert into an attempt
to rival him, while the sweet and
simple comedy of the stories has for more
than a quarter of a century been the delight
of young and old. The young man who
visited Mr. Gilder, and the brilliant novelist
solacing himself with the acquaintance of
Pomona, Ardis Claverden, Mrs. Null, and
Chipperton, are types.</p>

<p>The object of this variety of admiration
was born in Philadelphia on April 5, 1834.
On his father's side he is a descendant of
the Richard Stockton who signed the
Declaration of Independence. His father
was notable chiefly for his religious zeal.
He married twice, and his second wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was the author's mother. She was a Virginian;
and from her side of the family
tree was derived the name Ardis, found in
"Ardis Claverden." There is a Stocktonian
touch in the familiar story that the Christian
name of Francis Richard was imposed
upon Mr. Stockton by one of his half-sisters,
who borrowed half of it from Francis
I. of France and half from Richard
C&oelig;ur de Lion. Some readers will doubtless
remember Louise Stockton, Francis's
sister, who was given the name of Napoleon's
second wife.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, by the way, that with
a sister so ready in the choice of names the
novelist should himself find denomination
a troublesome phase of his art. "The
hardest work I have," he once said, "is
naming my characters. Many of them are
completely made up, others are suggested
by something, others are but slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
changed from real names. I seldom use a
name that in itself is a description of the
character. That was Dickens's way, you
remember. Nevertheless, sometimes one
of my names does describe the character.
Take Tippengray of 'The Squirrel Inn.'
Tippengray was a man whose hair was
slightly tipped with gray. I always liked
that name. Chipperton in 'A Jolly Fellowship'
is very descriptive also."</p>

<p>Francis Richard first went to a private
school in West Philadelphia. Later he attended
the public school, and at the age of
eighteen was graduated from the Central
High School with the degree of Bachelor of
Arts. It was noticed at school that his
bent was literary. In fact, this was obvious
to his parents when he was only ten, for at
that age he began to scribble verses. In
spite of this proclivity, however, the boy,
after leaving the high school, took up wood-carving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as a profession. Just one bond
existed between himself and the world of
letters, and that was his membership in a
high school organization called the "Literary
and Forensic Circle." Upon this slight
basis has been erected an exceptionally brilliant
career, for it was to the Circle that the
Ting-a-Ling stories were first read. These
stories were collected for his first book. The
Circle also heard "Kate" as soon as it was
written. This story and "The Story of
Champaigne" were published by the <i>Southern
Messenger</i>; and it is sufficient to say
that they created a demand for more like
them. Thereafter, until 1874, Stockton
wrote many short stories, his star all the
time rising a little higher above the horizon.</p>

<p>But in 1874 the star blazed forth wondrously
with the appearance of the first
part of "Rudder Grange." From that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
day the author's place among the famous
American humorists has been secure. The
primary effect of the remarkable success of
the first part of "Rudder Grange" was to
encourage the author to write a second
part; its next effect was to persuade him
to abandon wood-carving for literature.</p>

<p>There was an extraordinary infantile
tangle connected with the popular story.
In the original papers in <i>Scribner's</i> there
was no baby; in the first edition of the
book there was one baby; in the second
edition there were three babies; in the
third edition there were two. The author
finally let Pomona's baby disappear, for it
would have embarrassed her trip abroad.
The author tells a story about this baby.</p>

<p>"I had planned out the book of Pomona's
travels," he says, "and was about ready to
write it. I was in Philadelphia at the
time, and had a business appointment with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
my dentist, an old friend. By the way,
you should never change your dentist any
more than you should your plumber. Both
will want to take out the work of their
predecessors, swearing that it was done
very badly. Well, while in the chair I got
to talking with this dentist friend about
my new book. I told him I had serious
thoughts of killing the baby. He was
very much interested. We talked over
the advisability of doing this, and, while
he was not convinced, he in the main
agreed with me.</p>

<p>"I had been finished with, and clasping
his hand went into the waiting room on
my way out. This waiting-room was
filled with women. As I passed through
the door I heard him call:</p>

<p>"'Then you have positively decided to
kill that baby?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Positively,' I replied.</p>

<p>"You should have seen the women stare.
It was not until I got well out in the hallway
that I realized what they must, of
course, have thought."</p>

<p>Pomona, the heroine, existed in real
life. She was a charity girl whom the
Stocktons had taken into the family. She
was incorrigibly careless, however, and
back to the charitable institution she was
sent. She was stage-struck, too, and for
all we know--Mr. Stockton veils the
matter, half mysteriously,--she may have
escaped from her guardians and won bouquets
for herself before the footlights.
While we are on the subject of characters
real and imaginary we may add that Mrs.
Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine enjoyed actual
existence under more common names. It
has always been a source of affected trouble
to Stockton that some people will persist
in calling the former Mrs. Leeks and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
latter Mrs. Al-e-shi-ne, instead of Aleshine.</p>

<p>The author's success with these two
characters recalls the criticism that he was
ignorant of the way in which young folks
make love. "It is much more to my liking,"
he says, "to write about middle-aged
women than young women. The
older ones have more character; you can
make them do more amusing things."</p>

<p>But, to revert to the main line, "Rudder
Grange" carved its writer's name in
the Hall of Fame. It is undoubtedly his
most popular work, for there is a call for
it even at this late day. Some of his
admirers call it his masterpiece. It is no
backhanded compliment to say that he has
never improved upon the profusion or the
quaintness of its humor.</p>

<p>We have said that the success of "Rudder
Grange" induced Stockton to abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
everything but literature. He worked
first for the <i>Philadelphia Morning Post</i>;
later he joined Edward Eggleston on
<i>Hearth and Home</i>; by and by he cast his
lot with <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, and finally he
settled down on the editorial staff of <i>St.
Nicholas</i>. In this position he remained
until, in 1880, he gave up editorial work
altogether. Thereafter he devoted himself
entirely to fiction.</p>

<p>Even more sensational than the luck of
"Rudder Grange" was the luck of "The
Lady or the Tiger?" The story had a
phenomenal sale--for those days--in this
country, and it has been translated into
a few foreign languages. "Perhaps the
most interesting thing about 'The Lady
or the Tiger?'" says the humorist, "is its
great popularity among the savage races.
It has been told again and again by the
story-tellers of Burmah. A missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
once told the story to a tribe of Karens up
in the north of Burmah. When she came
back a year later the tribe surrounded her
and wanted to know if she had found out
whether--</p>

<p>"I cannot answer the question, for I
have no earthly idea myself. I really have
never been able to decide whether the
Lady or the Tiger came out of that door.
Yet I must defend myself. People for
years have upbraided me for leaving it a
mystery; some used to write me that I
had no right to impose upon the good
nature of the public in that manner. However,
when I started in to write the story,
I really intended to finish it. But it
would never let itself be finished. I could
not decide. And to this day, I have, I
assure you, no more idea than anyone
else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It used to be said that Mr. Stockton was
a short-story writer and nothing more, as
if that were not the most difficult branch
of fiction; but he silenced these reckless
critics with "The Late Mrs. Null," which,
in the beginning, had the biggest circulation
of all his books. Since then book has
followed book, regularly but not hurriedly.
The author of "Rudder Grange" does not
follow the plan of Trollope; he does not
work so many hours a day, mood or no
mood. Sometimes up to luncheon time not
a word has been put on paper.</p>

<p>He never writes; he dictates. In his
early days he dictated to his wife, but in
recent years he has employed a stenographer.
At any appointed hour in the
morning the young woman trips downstairs
from the room at the top of the
house to which she and her noisy typewriter
have been banished, and if the
author have his subject well in mind he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
delivers one thousand five hundred words
before the morning is over. From this
first draft the secretary makes the draft for
the printer, which seldom is revised. The
fact is, Stockton shapes his delightful
stories in his mind as effectively as most
other authors shape theirs on paper; and,
therefore, when a story has been dictated,
he is done with it. Mrs. Stockton, of
whom we spoke as his first amanuensis,
was Miss Marian E. Tuttle of Amelia
County, Virginia, visits to whose home
gave the novelist the impressions of negro
life which he has described so felicitously.
At present the Stocktons live near
Charlestown, West Virginia. The estate,
named Claymont, comprises one hundred
and fifty acres of a wide-spreading piece of
land once owned by Washington. The
house is said to have been planned by the
first President himself. At any rate, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was built by the immortal patriot's grandnephew,
and it takes its name from the
Washington homestead in England. Very
appropriately the edition of Mr. Stockton's
works has been given the title of Shenandoah.</p>

<p>Personally the fanciful story-teller is
small, spare, and shy. His is an elusive
personality. "A personality more winsome
and delightful," says one of his friends, "it
would be difficult to find. It is a small
man that sits before you, a keen-eyed man,
whose eyes you know miss nothing, a man
whose mustache is iron-gray and whose
hair is almost white. His photographs
give no hint of the man; they do not even
mirror his personal appearance. Nothing
save a talk with him gives you that."
Another friend has said: "The big dark
eyes, full of patient, weary expression, are
luminous; the mouth close and discouraged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
expands into smiling curves, sweet and
sympathetic; the whole soul is in the face,
and from head to foot, Frank Stockton is
the genial responsive man. It is like a
brilliant burst of sunshine following a
cloud, suddenly and unexpectedly, and
therefore more delicious in surprise and
beauty."</p>

<p>Everyone under this charmer's spell will,
we are sure, say with Edmund Clarence
Stedman:</p>

<h2>JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS<a id="harris"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">I</span></i><span class="smcap">n</span> an article published by <i>The Bookman</i>
not very long ago Mr. James
Lane Allen remarked that Uncle Remus
was one of the two names in American
fiction which have attained anything
like universality of acceptance, the other
name being, of course, Uncle Tom. And
yet fame was thrust upon Mr. Joel Chandler
Harris.</p>

<p>It happened in this wise. Mr. Harris
went to work for the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>
as an editorial writer in 1876, succeeding
Mr. Samuel W. Small, who has since prefixed
to his name the title of Reverend. Mr.
Small had made a success with sketches
dealing with a character called Uncle Si,
and Capt. Evan P. Howell, the editor of
the <i>Constitution</i>, desired to have the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
maintained in some form. So he approached
Mr. Harris with the suggestion
that he should try his hand at negro
sketches. The young writer was diffident.
He pleaded inexperience, incapability; but
Captain Howell wouldn't listen to the
excuses. In a good-natured way he pursued
his associate, requesting, begging,
entreating, encouraging. If Mr. Harris
would only put into black-and-white those
plantation stories with which he was accustomed
to entertain the staff! If he would
only get his courage up! Finally, the
young man yielded and put some of the
memories of his boyhood in Putnam
County, Georgia, into the mouth of a negro
named Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus he
has been ever since the publication of the
first sketch&mdash;Uncle Remus, famous and
beloved throughout the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Howell is said to have gone to
the editors' room the morning of the first
appearance of Uncle Remus and shouted:
"Well, Harris, you're a trump! If you
just keep up that lick your fortune is made.
Everybody is talking about Uncle Remus,
so give us another story." It was given
willingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris was born in 1848 in what
used to be known as Middle Georgia.
Like many another of our well-established
authors, he received a good part of his
education at the printer's case in a country
newspaper office. It was at the case&mdash;just
as in the story of Howells and of Mark
Twain&mdash;that the Georgian acquired his
love of journalism&mdash;a love which often
very naturally develops into a love for
higher and more durable literature. He
joined the staff of the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>
at the age of eighteen. For a time he served
as dramatic critic, in addition to his other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
service; but he soon found that he had no
taste for the theatre. It must be that it
was his hard lot to fall among poor actors,
for it was not long before he gave up the
work and formed a determination to visit
the theatre as seldom as possible. Thereafter,
he was virtually permitted by the editor
of the <i>Constitution</i> to follow his own bent.</p>

<p>But the story is moving along a little
too fast. It should be said that Mr. Harris
was fortunate in his birthplace. Eatonton,
the capital of Putnam County, was not a
lively spot, in a mercantile sense, in the
days before the war, but it could boast
of an excellent school, Eatonton Academy.</p>

<p>Speaking of Eatonton, the <i>Baltimore
American</i>, some thirteen or fourteen years
ago, printed this strange biography of Mr.
Harris under the title of "A Humorist's
Sad Romance":</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Joel C. Harris, the famous humorist,
of the <i>Atlanta</i> (Ga.) <i>Constitution</i>, has had
a strangely romantic career. His father
was a missionary, and it was at the small
town of Boog-hia, on the southern coast of
Africa, that Joel was born. He was educated
by his father, and is a profound
Sanscrit scholar, besides being thoroughly
versed in Hebraic and Buddhist literature.
Just before the Civil War he emigrated to
America, and taught school in a village
near Lake Teeteelootchkee, Fla. There
he fell in love with Sallie O. Curtis,
daughter of a wealthy planter, and soon
was engaged by Colonel Curtis as a private
tutor. The parents made no objection to
their daughter's choice of a husband, but
the war came on before the marriage could
take place, and so Colonel Curtis and Mr.
Harris went away to the war. The
Colonel lost all his property during the
strife, and at the battle of Columbia, S. C.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a grape shot tore his leg into shreds.
When the war closed Miss Sallie died of
yellow fever, and Mr. Harris became the
support and comfort of the maimed sire of
his dead sweetheart. The two yet live
together in a vine-covered cottage near
Atlanta. Mr. Harris is hardly forty years of
age, but his snow-white hair tells the sorrow
of his life. He is noted for his generosity,
his amiability and his tenderness."</p>

<p>The fact is that from the time of his
birth until General Sherman swept toward
the sea after burning Atlanta, Mr. Harris
lived in Eatonton. When he was six
years old he could read, and it is said that
a stray copy of "The Vicar of Wakefield,"
met in his juvenile days, did much to develop
his taste for good literature. Joel
attended Eatonton Academy for a few
terms, and at the age of twelve went to
work for Colonel Turner, the publisher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a weekly called <i>The Countryman</i>.</p>

<p>It was the boy's own enterprise and ambition
which brought this about. It was
Joel himself who heard that Colonel
Turner was in need of a boy with "willing
hands" to learn the printer's trade, and
who went unbidden and unendorsed to apply
for a job. The publisher and the
youngster took a liking to each other on
sight, and young Harris was put to work
forthwith.</p>

<p>Those were unquestionably among the
happiest days of the humorist's life. This
is not saying, of course, that his cup of
happiness is not brimming over to-day;
but those were days of new contentment.
The young printer's work was not burdensome;
but the happiest fact of all is that
his employer, Colonel Turner, had a rich
library, in which his youngest workman
was free to browse in leisure moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
The acorn of taste for good books which
the boy had cultivated at home here developed
into an oak; and the soil in which
the acorn took root was fertile, and there
was ample room for the spread of every
growing limb and bough.</p>

<p>At first the lad delved among the Elizabethans.
Sir Thomas Browne, too, became
one of his favorite authors&mdash;nowadays Mr.
Harris leans toward Thackeray, Stevenson,
Scott, Kipling and James Whitcomb
Riley&mdash;a good catholic taste. Few boys
ever enjoyed a more advantageous course
of reading. Gradually the juvenile printer
drifted from his books into writing, just
as a student one day quits the gallery and
starts to paint some work of his own.
Colonel Turner responded to the ambition
of his protégé most generously. He
praised the little works judiciously, and
before long young Harris was prompted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to doff his anonymity and stand up to be
judged by himself. Thereafter he became
a regular contributor to <i>The Countryman</i>&mdash;which
was truly rustic in scope as well as
in title&mdash;and the name of Harris began to
be spoken throughout Georgia.</p>

<p>This pleasant existence was interrupted
by the war, which to the editor and his
assistant was indeed the fulfilment of an
ancient threat. When Sherman left Atlanta
to march to the sea, he shaped his course
through Eatonton, and before him fled the
loyal Southerners. Among the last to
leave the town was the proprietor of <i>The
Countryman</i>. Young Harris remained behind
to look after the property. Little
damage was done in Eatonton, but the
budding author, finding the state of affairs
chaotic, started, when the war was over,
to make his fortune elsewhere. He found
employment on various newspapers, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in Macon, then in New Orleans, then in
Forsyth, and then in Savannah. In Savannah
he secured an editorial position on
the <i>Morning News</i>, of which W. T. Thompson,
the author of "Major Jones's Courtship,"
and other once popular humorous
writings, was then the general manager. In
Savannah, the vagrant Eatontonian married
Miss La Rose, and there he lived, with
ever-increasing success, until 1876, when
yellow fever swept through the town.
Then he moved to Atlanta and went to
work for the <i>Constitution</i>. And here we
shall take up the original thread of this
article.</p>

<p>In 1880, four years after the beginning
of Mr. Harris's connection with the <i>Constitution</i>,
the Uncle Remus sketches, which
meantime had won much praise throughout
the country, were numerous enough
to make a book of, and "Uncle Remus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
His Songs and Sayings" was published by
the Appletons. The book solidified the
author's fame. It had the good fortune
to be reprinted in England. Even then,
more than twenty years ago, it was reasonable
to say that Uncle Remus was one of
the foremost characters in American fiction.
In 1883, "Nights with Uncle Remus,"
was published; the following year "Mingo
and Other Sketches in Black and White";
in 1887, "Free Joe and Other Georgian
Sketches." Up to date, Harris's books
number at least sixteen.</p>

<p>But we must not lose sight of the fact
that all the time the successful story-teller
kept up his editorial work on the paper to
whose fame he was contributing so materially.
Indeed, until his retirement from
newspaper work, in 1900, his chief title
was that of a "hard-working journalist."
It was his habit until within recent years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to give his mornings and afternoons to the
<i>Constitution</i> work, and his evenings to
miscellaneous literary work. He was able
to maintain this arduous program for so
long a time because of his apparently inexhaustible
good nature and his simple
manner of life; and, moreover, attention
to duties at hand soon became second
nature in him. In recent years, however,
he gave only his mornings to his editorial
labors. "His habit," says an Atlanta correspondent,
"was to come down to the office
at nine o'clock in the morning, get his
editorial assignments for the day, and then
go home and do his work, sending his
copy down early in the afternoon." Such
was his spirit of independence that if the
editor chanced to be late in coming down
to the office he would not waste time in
waiting for him, but would pick up his
bundle of newspapers and start for home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Nevertheless, he would send in his copy
without fail. On making his morning
visit to the office Mr. Harris was never
out of sorts. His good humor was perennial,
and he never failed to impart it to
his co-workers. Though it was his lot to
write editorials on political topics, he never
enjoyed the rancor of partisan politics, and
he managed to put into his editorials
enough of humor to make the work pleasant
to himself as well as to others.</p>

<p>At the same time, the idol of the <i>Constitution</i>
staff, it is said, never took a hearty
interest in politics; he simply bowed to
the fact that as an editorial writer he
could hardly eschew politics entirely. But
he felt that he owed much to the <i>Constitution</i>
for the opportunity it had given
him to make his reputation; and he allowed
this circumstance to outweigh his
personal inclinations until the time came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
when he found that he would either have
to give up his editorial work or neglect his
literary contracts. So, finally, on Sept. 6,
1900, he departed from the office of the
<i>Constitution</i> for good, taking with him the
tearful love of all his associates. As a sort
of legacy, he left two sons on the paper,
Julian, the managing news editor, and
Evelyn, the city editor.</p>

<p>And then, almost at the end of his fifty-second
year, the dearest Georgian of them
all entered upon an unembarrassed literary
career, with every promise of doing more
work and better work than ever. But
even if this promise should rest unfulfilled&mdash;which
seems almost out of question&mdash;we
have with us Uncle Remus and Aunt
Minervy Ann, Brer Rabbit and Brer Fox,
creations unsurpassed in originality and in
delightfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Harris's work is done at his home in
West End, one of the suburbs of Atlanta,
and few visitors are permitted to interrupt
him. Not that he is gruff; he is simply
retiring. He prefers to be known by his
books. They who know him intimately&mdash;and
they are not many&mdash;say that he is
remarkably kind and hospitable. We respect
his desire for privacy. We will not
even knock on the door and beg one
glimpse of his private life. With the
whole reading public we shall be content
to note his boundless cheerfulness and
rare enjoyableness as a story-teller.</p>

<h2>S. WEIR MITCHELL<a id="mitchell"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i><span class="smcap">bout</span> sixty years ago Oliver Wendell
Holmes, taking dinner one
night in Philadelphia with his
friend, Dr. John K. Mitchell, was so pleased
with one of Dr. Mitchell's boys, by name
Silas Weir, then a little more than ten
years old, that he gave the boy a copy of
his famous ballad on the frigate Constitution.</p>

<p>Some seventeen years later, in 1856,
when Silas was a young doctor, with a
brand-new degree, he showed Dr. Holmes
a book of poems which he hoped to have
published. Dr. Holmes advised the young
man to put the poems away until he was
forty, and then to reconsider his determination
to have them published. "The publication
of these verses at this time," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the genial but shrewd Autocrat, "will do
you no good. They will not help you in
your life as a physician, and they cannot
stand alone." The soundness of Dr.
Holmes's judgment was later proved by the
circumstance that the young man blossomed
into one of the most distinguished
physicians of his time. Dr. Mitchell's
volume of poems, "The Hill of Stones,"
published about four years ago, contains
just one of the poems offered to the Boston
poet in 1856, namely, "Herndon." As an
author, Dr. Mitchell is less celebrated than
his friendly counsellor; but as a doctor he
is far more celebrated than was Dr. Holmes
in his palmiest days.</p>

<p>S. Weir Mitchell, one of the six sons of
Dr. John Kearsley Mitchell, was born in
Philadelphia on February 16, 1829. His
father was then a leader in his profession.
He was one of the first Americans to investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
scientifically "animal magnetism,"
as hypnotism was called in the
early part of the last century; and, moreover,
he was a highly valued contributor to
the medical periodicals of the day. It is
noteworthy that he had a taste for literature.
Two of his lyrics, "The Old Song
and the New Song" and "Prairie Lea,"
had a wide popularity in their day.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen Weir Mitchell
entered the University of Pennsylvania.
There he spent three years; and afterward
he entered Jefferson Medical College,
Philadelphia, in which his father was a
professor. One of the severest disappointments
in the son's life came in 1870,
twenty years after graduation, when, notwithstanding
the solicitation of influential
friends, he failed of election to a professorship
in Jefferson College. However,
this disappointment, like the one which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
met when he consulted Dr. Holmes about
his first book of poems, worked eventually
to his greater glory.</p>

<p>After graduation from Jefferson College
Dr. Mitchell, as we shall call our author
henceforth, went to Paris, whence, owing
to an attack of smallpox, he was obliged
to return in less than two years.</p>

<p>By this time the young doctor had lost
sight of his literary star. His ambition
was to teach medicine. The first article
from his pen appeared in the <i>American
Journal of Medical Science</i>. Other articles
followed with quick regularity, but to
none of these early writings, we believe,
does Dr. Mitchell attach much importance.
From 1858 until 1862, when he enlisted
as an army surgeon, the doctor devoted
his spare hours to the study of poisons,
particularly snake poisons. Not long after
the Civil War, by the way, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
largest rattlesnakes ever sent to him died
of cold. Dr. Mitchell had the skin preserved
and tanned, and he sent it to Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes with the suggestion
that it might make a worthy binding
for "Elsie Venner." "I thank you for it,"
Dr. Holmes wrote back, "especially because
it makes an attractive binding, and
I know that its bark is better than its
bite." It would be interesting to pursue
Dr. Mitchell's scientific achievements, but
such a pursuit would be too long to agree
with the purpose of this sketch.</p>

<p>However, his career as a war surgeon is
worth looking at, for it had something to do
with his subsequent advent as a writer of
fiction. Dr. Mitchell and his associates made
a deep study not only of the effects of certain
wounds but also of the effects of environment.
Much of the curious information
thus derived was given to the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
through the medical papers. It was undoubtedly
the study followed during this
period which formed the base of Dr.
Mitchell's now universally recognized success
as a neurologist. The universality of
his fame as a specialist in nervous diseases
has two substantial witnesses. One is the
oration delivered at Edinburgh University
in 1895, when he received the title of Doctor
of Laws. In that oration he was spoken of
as "the chief ornament to medical science
in the new world." The other witness is
the story of his visit some years ago to Dr.
Charcot, one of the great French authorities
on nervous diseases. Dr. Mitchell did not
give his name; he merely said that he was
from Philadelphia, and that there was
something the matter with his nerves.</p>

<p>"Why," said Dr. Charcot, "you should
never have come beyond Philadelphia for
advice for such an ailment. You have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
physician in your own city better qualified
to manage your case than I am."</p>

<p>"Indeed," the visitor is said to have remarked;
"and who may he be?"</p>

<p>"Dr. S. Weir Mitchell," replied Dr.
Charcot; "and as I know him by correspondence
I will venture to give you a
letter to him. You should consult him
upon your return home."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said the American smiling,
"I am Dr. S. Weir Mitchell."</p>

<p>Certainly a handsome compliment for
Dr. Mitchell! And certainly a remarkable
piece of professional modesty on the part
of Dr. Charcot!</p>

<p>Perhaps it is well to say at this point
that, in 1896, Harvard University also
honored Dr. Mitchell with the title of Doctor
of Laws; that he is a member of the American
National Academy of Sciences, an
honorary member of the Clinical Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of London, the London Medical Society,
the Royal Academy of Medicine of Rome,
and a corresponding member of many
other foreign medical societies; and that
he was once President of the Congress of
American Physicians and Surgeons. In
1888 the University of Bologna conferred
on him the title of Doctor of Medicine.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell's entrance into romantic
literature was made anonymously and, it
might be said, accidentally. Soon after
the close of the Civil War, the story goes,
he and some professional associates one
day discussed all sides of the question
whether the loss of the limbs involves the
loss of the victim's individuality. As a
result of that discussion Dr. Mitchell
wrote the story of the fictitious case of
one George Dedlow, who had suffered the
loss of his arms and his legs. The story,
which, as they who have read it know, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
an intensely interesting complication of
romance and science, came to the hands of
the Rev. Dr. Furness, one of Dr. Mitchell's
friends, who took the liberty of sending it
to Edward Everett Hale, in Boston. Dr.
Hale, who, at that time, was at the height
of his literary power, saw that the story
was rare material, and he submitted it
forthwith to the editor of <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>. It was promptly accepted, and
the first Dr. Mitchell knew of what had
happened was when he received a proof of
the story, together with a good-sized check
and a note complimenting him on the
freshness and attractiveness of his article.
"The Case of George Dedlow," indeed,
was described so realistically that, according
to tradition, subscriptions were raised
for the poor victim's support and comfort.
The newspapers, too, started a discussion
of the prodigy, and it was a long time before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the public became persuaded that the
tale was utter fiction, put together with
extraordinary skill.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell's first book was "Children's
Hours," a collection of fairy tales, illustrated
by Dr. John Packard. The book
was in no sense a great literary effort; it
was intended to serve, and did serve, a
charitable purpose. His first novel was
"In War Times," published serially in
<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1885. Between
that time and the publication of "Hugh
Wynne" in 1897, the Philadelphian wrote
a number of works, the most notable
among which were a few dramatic poems.
The poems delighted the critical; they
were caviare to the general. Dr. Mitchell
is not a poet of the "golden clime" of
which Tennyson speaks; he has simply
found in poetry the fittest vehicle for the
expression of some attractive and stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
ideas. His verse reveals his fine sympathy
with the true poets rather than his intimate
association with them.</p>

<p>Unqualified success came to the veteran
author with the publication in 1897 of
"Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker," which
will be remembered in years to come as
one of the choicest of American novels.
The writing of "Hugh Wynne," which
was done at Bar Harbor in the summer of
1896, in less than two months, took years
of preparation. It is said that he wrote to
a woman "for the name and a full description
of every article of apparel worn by a
lady in America in the years before and
about the time" of the Revolution. Moreover:
"One will find on the shelves of
his library at home," says a casual biographer,
"great rows of books consulted in
the preparation of the novel, and among
them, as samples, will be noticed Keith's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
'Provincial Councillors of Pennsylvania,'
Watson's 'Annals,' Trumble's 'The Knightly
Soldier,' Fiske's 'Critical Period of American
History,' 'The True George Washington,'
by Ford; Professor McMaster's
'History of the United States,' 'The Cannoneer,'
by Buell, and scores of others,
some of them very rare." We find it also
said that every chapter of importance in
the story was written at least twice, and
that some chapters were written even three
times, before the manuscript was sent to
the publisher. Nothing which Dr. Mitchell
has written since shows a power equal to
the power of "Hugh Wynne." That
novel, therefore, must be regarded as his
supreme literary effort. "The Adventures
of François" proved entertaining and
nothing more; its early popularity was an
echo of the immense popularity of the
Revolutionary story. "Dr. North and His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Friends" is not, as many suppose, an autobiography;
but it may fairly be said that
by means of Dr. North the author relates
some of his most remarkable personal impressions
and personal experiences.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes was once a little disturbed,
and much amused, at the same time, by a
reference to his "medicated writings."
The careful reader will note a strong pathological
element in most of Dr. Mitchell's
works; not enough, however, to warrant
describing them as "medicated." The
fact is, Dr. Mitchell has made good use of
his rare scientific knowledge in the development
of many of his characters. One of
his intimate friends is reported to have
said once that the doctor is constantly
studying human characteristics, especially
the characteristics of singular persons. "He
picks out their brains in a very fine and
delicate way," said the friend. "Thus he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
studies human nature, much in that same
synthetical manner in which he dissects a
physical malady."</p>

<p>Personally the author of "Hugh Wynne"
is described as gentle, cordial, and, in convivial
company, very entertaining. It has
frequently been said of him that he appears
to be what he is,&mdash;a scholar and a scientist.</p>

<p>Some years ago, when Dr. Mitchell was
a guest in one of the semi-literary clubs
in London, he and the circle around him
fell into a discussion of problem novels,
which finally resolved itself into a discussion
of "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," then
in the heyday of its popularity. Dr.
Mitchell took his ground on two points:
he expressed admiration of Mr. Hardy as
an artist, but utter dislike of the scheme
of "Tess." A man who had meantime
joined the circle entered quietly and unobtrusively
into the conversation, admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the force of some of Dr. Mitchell's general
objections to problem novels, but maintaining
the ethical and artistic merits of the
plan of Judge Hardy's new book. The
newcomer showed such an intimate knowledge
of the construction of "Tess" that
the American paid more than ordinary
attention to him. At length, when the
company was dispersing, Dr. Mitchell's
host, with an innocent smile, proceeded to
make the two debaters formally acquainted
with each other.</p>

<p>"This is a friend of mine, Doctor," he
said to his guest, "about whose work you
know a great deal. Allow me to introduce
to you Thomas Hardy, with whom
you can hardly find any fault for defending
poor Tess."</p>

<p>The acquaintance thus curiously begun
has since ripened into a rich friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell does most of his literary
work at Bar Harbor, in the summer. There
is no sign of the end of this pure labor of
love; but the work which exists already is
sufficient, in itself, to show that a man burdened
with the gravest interests of medical
science may give profitable and brilliant
employment to his imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h2>ROBERT GRANT<a id="grant"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">R</span></i><span class="smcap">obert Grant</span> leads the American
satirists. Many writers, unnamed
paragraphers and critics of
high degree, have pursued him relentlessly;
but he will not surrender. Contrariwise,
it is more likely that they will yet surrender
to him. He has Napoleon's way of
turning upon pursuers.</p>

<p>The satirist is not always clearly understood.
For some of this misunderstanding
the satirist himself is to blame. Mr.
Grant, for example, has never yet explained
what he meant by saying in "The Art of
Living" that a satisfactory life demands an
income of ten thousand a year. On the
other hand, some of the misunderstanding
is due to a lack of humor among his critics.
And at the bottom of the misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is the natural inconsistency which prompted
Mr. Aldrich to write in "Marjorie Daw"&mdash;"I
have known a woman to satirize a man
for years, and marry him after all."</p>

<p>An incident which took place not long
ago illustrates Judge Grant's sincerity. The
statement had been made in a periodical
now defunct that "a sufficiency of money
has made things pretty pleasant for our literary
philosopher." Although averse, unlike
many professional writers, to taking
advantage of opportunities for controversy,
the Judge made this reply to the statement:
"It is true that for some years I
have had a comfortable income; but if I
have been able to command the advantages
of modern life at the rate of $10,000 a year,
it is because I have earned the money by
the sweat of my brow through literary and
legal work, and not because my 'judicial
seat' is 'padded' with inherited stocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bonds.... It may interest those who have
convinced themselves that my philosophy is
founded on a patrimony, to know that from
the time I left the Law School in 1879 the
yearly income which I have received from
vested property has been so small as barely
to pay for the life insurance which I carry,
and that I have acquired the money which
I spend or save by my own exertions. It is
true that I was brought up in comfort and
given every opportunity to follow my tastes,
but this is all I owe to family income."</p>

<p>The incident is worth recalling for the
light which it throws on the novelist's economical
position. The man who is competent
to make ten thousand a year is welcome
to his enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>Robert Grant first earned some celebrity
as a writer while at Harvard, which he entered
after his graduation from the Boston
Latin School in 1869, when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
seventeen years old. His literary career
began with his contributions to the college
papers, notably <i>The Lampoon</i>. That his
literary skill was recognized at Harvard is
proved by his election to the office of class
poet at graduation, in 1873. That summer,
while abroad, he seems to have determined
upon following his first taste, to use his own
expression; for at the end of the summer
he went back to Harvard for a three years'
course in English and foreign literature,
upon the completion of which he received
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.</p>

<p>Why he decided to choose another profession
has never been divulged, but, anyhow,
at the end of the summer of 1876, he entered
the Harvard Law School. Three years
afterward he was graduated from it, and
forthwith he became a member of the Bar
and an active practitioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Grant left Harvard with a budding
reputation. In company with Mr. F. J.
Stimson ("J. S. of Dale"), Barrett Wendell
(now professor of English at Harvard),
F. G. Attwood, whose untimely death has
bereft our literature of one of its happiest
decorators, and Mr. John T. Wheelwright,
now a lawyer in Boston, he had polished
<i>The Lampoon</i> considerably. Perhaps his
most popular work at this time was "The
Little Tin Gods on Wheels; or, Society in
our Modern Athens," a burlesque after the
Greek manner, which appeared in <i>The
Lampoon</i>, with illustrations by Attwood.
In fact, it was to be found in a book published
by Sever, together with the young
satirist's other promising works, "The Wall
Flowers," "The Chaperons," and "Oxygen,
a Mt. Desert Pastoral," squibs dealing
with the foibles of fashionable society.</p>

<p>Thus favorably introduced to the reading
public, he lost no time in striking the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
while it was hot, and in 1880 gave out his
first novel, "The Confessions of a Frivolous
Girl," which, by reason of its remarkable
exposition of the character of the leading
lady, as she may be called, and its popular
attractiveness, won immediate success at
home and abroad. Three years later his
second book, "The Knave of Hearts," the
autobiography of a ruthless young man,
was published; and the same year appeared
in <i>The Century</i> the articles which make up
"An Average Man," and a satire on Wall
Street entitled "The Lambs, a Tragedy."
In 1883, too, it may be mentioned, Mr.
Grant read at the Phi Beta Kappa reunion
at Harvard a poem called "Yankee
Doodle." In 1885 "A Romantic Young
Lady," another skit on fashionable life,
made its appearance; and that year he also
served as the poet of the two hundred and
fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Boston Latin School.</p>

<p>The following year, 1886, he finished
what, up to that time, was by far his
most serious work, "Face to Face," which
was published anonymously. In it Anglomania
and the labor problem are touched
on boldly and brilliantly, and even to-day
the points of the book are fresh and sparkling.
Later came "The Reflections of a
Philosopher," "The Opinions of a Married
Man," "Searchlight Letters," "The Art of
Living," and, last of all, "Unleavened
Bread." "He says," once remarked a
man, "what you have thought and wanted
to say yourself"; and a better compliment
could hardly be paid his philosophy.</p>

<p>A writer who went to see Judge Grant
some years ago said: "He has cultivated
to a rare degree the faculty which is of the
utmost importance to every literary man,
namely, that of concentration. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[1762</a></span>
part of his writing is done during the intervals
of business in the morning hours at his
office. There, the casual visitor is almost
certain to find him, seated at his desk, with
his manuscript spread out before him. He
will drop his pen, upon the instant, to consider
some point of legal technique, with
which imagination has nothing whatever to
do, listen attentively, take notes or give advice,
as though this were the sole object of
his existence; then, when the interruption
ceases, he will turn back to his unwritten
page, finishing that and another too, it may
be, before the morning goes, if he is in the
vein. This power of leaving off and beginning
again quickly was not easily acquired.
It is the result of long training in years of
practical experience. But, like every true
artist, Mr. Grant really carries his work
with him wherever he goes. He is always
recording and storing up impressions, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mental notes, or working out details of construction,
even when these matters seem to
be the farthest from his thoughts; and he
is accustomed to say that the actual writing
of a story troubles him very little since, with
him, when writing begins, the most difficult
part of the task is already accomplished.
But, in spite of his fluent pen, he has
learned to look at his work objectively, and
he is extremely self-critical, having destroyed
more than once a tale half told, from
conviction that it failed to do him justice."</p>

<p>In 1882 Mayor Green of Boston selected
Mr. Grant as his private secretary, and in
1888 Mayor O'Brien of Boston appointed
him a member of the board of water commissioners.
This latter post he held until
a few years ago, when he was appointed a
Judge in the Probate Court of Suffolk
County, sitting in Boston. There, almost
every day, he may be seen by anyone visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Boston, a medium-sized, delicate-looking
man, with shrewd features, an eye sharp
as a detective's, a somewhat brisk manner,
and a faint but pleasant voice, to which the
most learned counsel lend eager ears. Since
his appointment to the Bench he has limited
his literary activity to two hours a day,
which short but productive period he has
been wont to spend generally at the Athenæum
Library on Beacon Street, a stone's
throw from the Court House.</p>

<p>Judge Grant is very happy in his children,
and this circumstance may account for
his delightful books for boys, "Jack Hall"
and "Jack in the Bush." He is a keen
though perhaps not enthusiastic sportsman.
Every few years he and his wife, who was
Miss Galt, the eldest daughter of Sir Alexander
Tillock Galt, the Canadian statesman,
go bicycling in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>This excursive disposition does not narrow
his enjoyment of what is best in town
life. It has been said of him: "He is
not only an admirable talker with a nimble
wit, apt at repartee, but he is also a genial
sympathetic listener, thus combining very
happily the qualities which make a man
hail-fellow-well met wherever he goes; and
no one meeting Mr. Grant for the first time
can fail to recognize and delight in that
quick sense of humor which is so characteristic
of his writing."</p>

<p>A few years ago he was interviewed
regarding his likes and dislikes. He said
that his favorite prose authors were
Thackeray and Balzac, his favorite poets,
Shakespeare and Goethe, his favorite book,
"Vanity Fair," his favorite play, "Hamlet,"
his favorite heroines in fiction, Becky Sharp
and Eugénie Grandet, his favorite heroes in
fiction, Santa Claus and Brer Rabbit; and
he admires truth most in men and loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sympathy in women.</p>

<p>His strength as a writer lies in an unsurpassed
ability to detect and delineate
shams, and this ability shines brilliantly in
the character of Selma White, the heroine
of "Unleavened Bread." The book is a
protest against superficiality; the character
of Selma White is a monument of vanity.
We have all met Selmas, rampant women&mdash;there
are men like them, of course&mdash;who
flatter themselves that they are born to
grace every resting-place and brush aside
difficulties that would have staggered Napoleon
or Catherine de Medici. The author
has contradicted the opinion that Selma is a
shaft aimed at women's clubs. "It is simply
that modern women's clubs are the best
medium for that kind of women," he says
"that I depicted Selma as a prime mover
in some of them. But she exists outside of
women's clubs probably more plentifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
than in them."</p>

<p>It has been said that Judge Grant is timid
about forcing his way into public attention.
The reply quoted from early in this article
was an exception to an apparently firmly established
rule. At the time when comment
on his ten-thousand-a-year proposition was
severest Judge Grant wrote to a friend for
advice, and he was very easily persuaded to
give no heed to his critics. At the same
time, if what he had thought of saying
would have blown the fog away, it would
have been better for him then to have settled
the question decisively. But, he was
content for the nonce to have his retiring
disposition approved; and a philosopher of
this type rather invites than forbids attack.
But, after all, even his harshest critics
praise his rare skill in the exposition of
character, his remarkable fertility of wit,
and his complete mastery of the technique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of literature. Nor is it to be gainsaid that
his career has illustrated the wisdom of his
lines in "The Lambs":</p>

<h2>F. MARION CRAWFORD<a id="crawford"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">S</span></i><span class="smcap">ince</span> 1893, when he made his first
tour through the country as a lecturer,
F. Marion Crawford has become
a somewhat familiar figure to many
Americans, who have noted his athletic
form, his handsome face, his melodious
voice, his polished deportment. He is
easily the best known of the American
authors who make their homes abroad.</p>

<p>In Major Pond's "Reminiscences," by
the way, they who have heard Mr. Crawford
read from his novels or recite his description
of Pope Leo XIII, will find a very
interesting account of the author's experiences
during his American tours.</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford is a cosmopolite of the first
rank. He was born in Bagni di Lucca,
Italy, August 2, 1854. His father was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Thomas Crawford, the famous sculptor,
who, born in the west of Ireland and reared
in America, had, some years before, been
sent to Rome to master his profession. He
had finished studying with the great Thorwaldsen,
and had made a reputation of his
own, when he met and married Miss Louisa
Ward, who was visiting Rome with Dr.
Samuel G. Howe and his wife, Julia Ward
Howe. Marion was the youngest of four
children. One of his sisters, Mrs. Fraser,
has made no small name for herself as a
writer.</p>

<p>At the age of two, Marion was sent to
live for awhile with kinsfolk in Bordentown,
N. J. "Among the earliest things that I
remember," he said once to an interviewer,
"is my great delight in watching the coming
and going of the trains as they shot
across the farm near the old house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>His father died in 1857, and then Marion
was taken back to Italy, where he spent his
early days.</p>

<p>"Most of my boyhood," he said, to an
interviewer, when he was in this country on
his first lecture tour, "was spent under the
direction of a French governess. Not only
did I learn her language from her, but all
of my studies, geography, arithmetic, and
so forth, were taught me in French, and I
learned to write it with great readiness, as
a mere boy, because it was the language of
my daily tasks. The consequence is that
to this day I write French with the ease of
English. There have been times when I
know that I have lost some of my facility
in speaking French through long absence
from the country, but the acquirement of
writing is always with me, which shows the
value of early impressions in that direction."</p>

<p>When twelve years old Marion was sent
to St. Paul's School, Concord, N. H., where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he remained for two years. Readers familiar
with his portraits will remember that
in most of them he is represented as smoking.
This inveterate habit he acquired during
his first year's residence at St. Paul's.</p>

<p>The age of fifteen found the migrant
youth back in Rome again, where he took
up the study of Greek and mathematics.
Later he studied with a private tutor at
Hatfield Broadoak, in Essex, England, and
from this school he went to Trinity College,
Cambridge, where he passed four terms.
There he perfected himself in German,
Swedish and Spanish. He found German
of good use when, later, he studied at
Karlsruhe and at Heidelberg. At the age
of twenty-two he returned to Rome to
study at the University of Rome. There
one of the professors interested him in
Buddhism and the other Oriental mysteries.
This professor, who recognized the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
pupil's aptitude in languages, advised him
to go to India and study Sanscrit, and then
returning, he could readily obtain a professorship.
The advice appealed to young
Crawford, and he borrowed a hundred
pounds and sailed for Bombay. There he
occasionally wrote articles for one of the
newspapers, but his employment was uncertain,
and two pounds represented all his
worldly possessions when the editor of the
<i>Bombay Gazette</i> informed him that the
editor of the <i>Allahabad Indian Herald</i> was
in need of a "good man." Would he take
the position? "Would a duck swim?"
said Mr. Crawford; and off he went to
Allahabad, a thousand miles away. There
he learned that the "good man" was supposed
to fill the posts of reporter, managing
editor and editorial writer, with now and
then a turn at type-setting. Thus none of
the sixteen hours of the working day would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
be wasted. But Mr. Crawford couldn't
afford to grumble. Instead he buckled
down to what he describes as the hardest
eighteen months' work of his life.</p>

<p>In 1880, at the age of twenty-six, with
no valuable possessions except his experience,
he returned to Rome, and thence,
early in 1881, he set out for America.
The old steamship in which he took passage
broke down in mid-ocean, and Mr. Crawford's
great physical strength and nervous
energy were in constant demand. As the
only cabin passenger on board, he had
the honor of alternating on deck with the
captain and the mates. At Bermuda,
where the ship put in for repairs, he narrowly
escaped drowning. Finally, at the
end of two months, the ship reached New
York. In this country he made his home
at times with his uncle, Samuel Ward, the
Horace of "Dr. Claudius," and at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with his aunt, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe.
He had not been long in the country before
he entered Harvard College, where he took
a special course in Sanscrit under Prof.
Charles Lanman.</p>

<p>He left Harvard in a state of uncertainty.
He was ready to do anything to earn a
living. He tried unsuccessfully to place
some articles on philology. He reviewed
books, principally for the <i>New York Times</i>.
He lectured on "The Origin of Sacrifice."
He won a small sum of money with an
article on the silver question. One day
early in May, 1882, his kind uncle, Samuel
Ward, asked him to dinner at the New
York Club, which was then situated in
Madison Square. But here is where Mr.
Crawford should come in to tell his own
interesting story:</p>

<p>"As was perfectly natural, we began to
exchange stories while smoking, and I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
him (Mr. Ward), with a great deal of detail,
my recollections of an interesting man
whom I met in Simla. When I had finished,
he said to me: 'That is a good two-part
magazine story, and you must write it
out immediately.' He took me around to
his apartments, and that night I began to
write the story of 'Mr. Isaacs.' Part of
the first chapter was written afterward, but
the rest of that chapter and several succeeding
chapters are the story I told to Uncle
Sam. I kept at it from day to day, getting
more interested in the work as I proceeded,
and from time to time I would read a
chapter to Uncle Sam. When I got
through the original story I was so amused
with the writing of it that it occurred to
me that I might as well make Mr. Isaacs
fall in love with an English girl, and then
I kept on writing to see what would happen.
By and by I remembered a mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Buddhist whom I had met once in India,
and so I introduced him, still further to
complicate matters. I went to Newport to
visit my aunt, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,
while I was in the midst of the story, and
continued it there. It was on June 13,
1882, while in her home, that I finished
the last chapter of 'Mr. Isaacs,' and, Uncle
Sam appearing in Newport at that time, I
read him the part of the story which he
had not heard. 'You will give it to me,'
he said, 'and I shall try to find a publisher.'
He had for many years frequented the
bookstore of Macmillan, and was well acquainted
with the elder George Brett. He
took the manuscript to Mr. Brett, who forwarded
it to the English house, and in a
short time it was accepted.</p>

<p>"Having tasted blood, I began, very
soon after finishing 'Mr. Isaacs,' to write
another story for my own amusement, 'Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Claudius.' Late in November I was advised
by the Messrs. Macmillan that in
order to secure an English copyright, as
well as an American copyright, I must be
on English soil on the day of publication.
So I went to St. John, New Brunswick,
where I had a very pleasant time, and continued
to write the story of 'Dr. Claudius,'
which I finished in December. 'Mr.
Isaacs' was published on December 6, and
I, of course, knew nothing about its reception.
However, toward the end of the
month I started on my return journey to
the United States, and when I arrived in
Boston on the day before Christmas, and
stepped out of the train, I was surprised
beyond measure to find the railway news
stand almost covered with great posters announcing
'Mr. Isaacs.' The next morning,
at my hotel, I found a note awaiting me
from Thomas Bailey Aldrich, then editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, asking me for an
interview, at which he proposed that I write
a serial for his magazine. I felt confident
then, and do now, that 'Dr. Claudius'
would not be a good serial story. However,
I promised that Mr. Aldrich should
have a serial, and began soon after to write
'A Roman Singer,' which was completed
in February, 1883."</p>

<p>That is Mr. Crawford's own story of his
start as a novelist, told to us nine years
ago in a Boston hotel. The original of
Mr. Isaacs was a diamond dealer in Simla
named Jacobs. We have heard it related
that the chief figure in "A Roman Singer"
was partly sketched from a musician now
resident in Boston, whom the novelist had
known intimately in Rome. The American
scenery of "Dr. Claudius" was, of
course, fresh in the author's mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Crawford said last year: "What a
novelist needs in order to succeed is energy
above all else. But he also needs to be
very poor. No man with money will work
hard enough when he is young to succeed.
He needs to begin early, work hard, and sit
long in one place. If he has money he
won't sit long in one place." Mr. Crawford
had no money when he started, but he had
abundant energy, and he could sit for a
day in one place. Hence his success. In
"The Three Fates" the close reader will
discern a glimpse of the foundation of Mr.
Crawford's literary career.</p>

<p>In May, 1883, the rising author went
back to Italy, where he wrote "To Leeward"
and "Saracinesca." The next year
he spent in Constantinople, and there he
was married to Miss Elizabeth Berdan, the
daughter of General Berdan. In 1885 he
settled permanently at Sorrento. "Villa
Crawford," his home, stands on a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
bluff, overlooking the Bay of Naples. There,
in a room padded to keep out sound, the
author of "Mr. Isaacs" has done most of
his literary work for the last fifteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford has frequently been called
"a born novelist," and we have yet to find
a critic who, judging him by all that he
has done, is inclined to deny him the right
to that high title. His dialogue is vivid,
his problems, as a rule, logically worked
out, his dramatic situations strong and
timely. Not all his works, however, are of
even power or attractiveness; and no one
recognizes this fact more clearly than the
novelist himself. He has said that the
book which he enjoyed writing most is
"Mr. Isaacs"; the book which has for
him the most reality is "Pietro Ghisleri,"
and the book of the most polish is "Zoroaster."
In years gone by "Zoroaster"
was studied in the English departments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
many colleges.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Mr. Crawford, last year,
"that the novelist is the result of a demand.
Consequently, I believe that it is
the province of the novel to amuse, to cultivate,
mainly to please. I do not believe
that the novel should instruct. The story
is the great thing. Therefore, I do not
believe in problem novels, or what they call
realism. It is disagreeable to the people."
Yet, in his thirty-six works, he has said, to
use his own words, some "pretty tall
things."</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford attributes much of his skill
in writing English to the letters which his
mother used to write to him when he was
away at school. After she had married Mr.
Terry, her home in Rome, the Palazzo
Odescalchi, became the meeting-place of
many brilliant men and women. Artists,
poets and literarians crowded her house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
every Wednesday afternoon, and this choice
admiration of her ended only with her death.
Of French, German, and, of course Italian,
her brilliant son is as sure a master as he
is of English; he writes Turkish and Russian
readily, and he converses fluently in
most of the Eastern tongues. His recreation
is yachting. Indeed he holds a shipmaster's
certificate entitling him to navigate
sailing vessels on the high seas. Five years
ago he proved his seamanship by navigating
his yacht, an old New York pilot
boat, across the seas to Sorrento.</p>

<p>All in all, a delightful and accomplished
author and gentleman-at-large.</p>

<h2>JAMES LANE ALLEN<a id="allen"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">few</span> novelists know the world
which renews its youth every
spring and that dies every autumn,
as intimately as Thoreau knew it. One of
these novelists is Thomas Hardy, whose
description of Egdon Heath in "The Return
of the Native" has long been in use
as a model in the English Department at
Harvard. One of these also is James Lane
Allen, the Kentucky schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The chapter entitled "Hemp" in "The
Reign of Law," contains abundant evidence
of this loving power. Here is a random
choice:</p>

<p>"One day something is gone from earth
and sky: Autumn has come, season of
scales and balances, when the earth, brought
to judgment for its fruits, says, 'I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
done what I could&mdash;now let me rest!'</p>

<p>"Fall!&mdash;and everywhere the sights and
sounds of falling. In the woods, through
the cool silvery air, the leaves, so indispensable
once, so useless now. Bright day
after bright day, dripping night after dripping
night, the never-ending filtering or
gusty fall of leaves. The fall of walnuts,
dropping from bare boughs with muffled
boom into the deep grass. The fall of the
hickory-nut, rattling noisily down through
the scaly limbs and scattering its hulls
among the stones of the brook below. The
fall of buckeyes, rolling like balls of mahogany
into the little dust paths made by
sheep, in the hot months, when they had
sought those roofs of leaves. The fall of
acorns, leaping out of their matted green
cups as they strike the rooty earth. The
fall of red haw, persimmon, and pawpaw,
and the odorous wild plum in its valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thickets. The fall of all seeds whatsoever
of the forest, now made ripe in their high
places and sent back to the ground, there
to be folded in against the time when they
shall rise again as the living generations;
the homing, downward flight of the seeds
in the many-colored woods all over the
quiet land."</p>

<p>Mr. Mabie, writing once in <i>The Outlook</i>,
dwelt on what has been called the "landscape
beauty" of Mr. Allen's work. "No
American novelist," he said "has so imbedded
his stories in Nature as has James
Lane Allen; and among English novels one
recalls only Mr. Hardy's three classics of
pastoral England, and among French novelists
George Sand and Pierre Loti. Nature
furnishes the background of many charming
American stories, and finds delicate or
effective remembrance in the hands of
writers like Miss Jewett and Miss Murfree;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
but in Mr. Allen's romances Nature is not
behind the action; she is involved in it.
Her presence is everywhere; her influence
streams through the story; the deep and
prodigal beauty which she wears in rural
Kentucky shines on every page; the tremendous
forces which sweep through her
disclose their potency in human passion and
impulse...."</p>

<p>And when James MacArthur was editing
<i>The Bookman</i> he said: "Poetry, 'the
breath and finer spirit of all knowledge,'
according to Wordsworth, 'the impassioned
expression which is in the countenance of
all science,'&mdash;that poetry irrespective of
rhyme and metrical arrangement which is
as immortal as the heart of man, is distinctive
in Mr. Allen's work from the first
written page. Like Minerva issuing full-formed
from the head of Jove, Mr. Allen
issues from his long years of silence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
seclusion a perfect master of his art&mdash;unfailing
in its inspiration, unfaltering in its
classic accent." It was Mr. MacArthur,
who, speaking of "The Choir Invisible,"
said that "it would be difficult to recall
any other novel since 'The Scarlet Letter'
that has touched the same note of greatness,
or given to one section of our national life,
as Hawthorne's classic did to another, a
voice far beyond singing."</p>

<p>Mr. MacArthur's remark that Mr. Allen
came forth from "his long years of silence
and seclusion a perfect master of his art"
is largely true. Although born about half
a century ago, it was not until 1884 that
he settled down to writing. Not many of
our distinguished writers passed thirty before
tasting the bitter-sweet fruit of authorship.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen was born on a farm in Fayette
County, Kentucky, a few miles from Lexington;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and on the farm he spent his early
childhood. His mother's maiden name was
Helen Foster. Her parents, who were of
the Scotch-Irish stock which settled in
Pennsylvania before the Revolution, had
found a permanent home in Mississippi.
On his father's side he is a descendant of
the Virginians who formed the Kentucky
pioneers. The son was graduated from
Kentucky University&mdash;which has been
pictured in the history of his latest hero,
David,&mdash;in 1872. For several years afterward
he taught in district schools, at first
near his home, and later in Missouri. Still
later he became a private tutor; then he
took a professorship in his alma mater;
and at length he brought his career as a
teacher to a close while at Bethany College,
West Virginia. That very year,
1884, he moved to New York, put away
his text-books, and plunged into the sea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
literature. One who knew him in those
days has described him as "a blond young
giant with a magnificent head and a strong,
kindly face."</p>

<p>From the day of his decision to be a
writer until the present time Mr. Allen
has worked industriously and successfully.
Fifteen years ago the chief literary and
critical magazines published many of his
essays, and from time to time his short
stories appeared in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> and
<i>The Century Magazine</i>. These short stories
were afterward collected and published
under the title of "Flute and Violin."
Then appeared at irregular intervals "The
Blue Grass Region of Kentucky," "A
Kentucky Cardinal" and its sequel, "Aftermath,"
"A Summer in Arcady," "The
Choir Invisible," and, latest of all, "The
Reign of Law."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The author's high reputation was firmly
established by "A Kentucky Cardinal"
and "Aftermath." "In these two books,"
said one critic, looking backward, "Nature
was interwoven benignantly with the human
nature resting on her bosom, leading
her lover, Adam Moss, with gentle influences
to the human lover, and, when bereft
of human love, receiving him back into
her healing arms." The books made as
deep an impression upon Englishmen as
upon Americans; indeed, as late as the
spring of 1900 the <i>London Academy</i> devoted
a page to a flattering and most sympathetic
review of them. The gentle, playful
humor, the healthy joyousness, the rare tenderness
displayed by Mr. Allen in these two
books, are irresistible. Months, and even
years, after laying the books down, the
reader must remember the many delightful
sketches of which they are made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"And while I am watching the birds,
they are watching me. Not a little fop
among them, having proposed and been accepted,
but perches on a limb, and has the
air of putting his hands mannishly under
his coat-tails and crying out to me, 'Hello!
Adam, what were you made for?' 'You
attend to your business, and I'll attend to
mine,' I answer, 'You have one May; I
have twenty-five!' He didn't wait to
hear. He caught sight of a pair of clear
brown eyes peeping at him out of a near
tuft of leaves, and sprang thither with open
arms and the sound of a kiss."</p>

<p>What charming sport! What uncommon
perception! And here is one of his
choice, frank, bucolic sentiments:</p>

<p>"The longer I live here the better satisfied
I am in having pitched my earthly
camp-fire, gypsylike, on the edge of a town,
keeping it on one side, and the green fields,
lanes and woods on the other. Each, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
turn, is to me as a magnet to the needle.
At times the needle of my nature points
towards the country. On that side everything
is poetry. I wander over field and
forest, and through me runs a glad current
of feeling that is like a clear brook across
the meadows of May. At others the needle
veers round, and I go to town&mdash;to the
massed haunts of the highest animal and
cannibal. That way nearly everything is
prose. I can feel the prose rising in me
as I step along, like hair on the back of a
dog, long before any other dogs are in
sight. And, indeed, the case is much that
of a country dog come to town, so that
growls are in order at every corner. The
only being in the universe at which I have
ever snarled, or with which I have rolled
over in the mud and fought like a common
cur, is Man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Summer in Arcady" shocked many
who had fallen in love with the pastoral
simplicity and spiritual delicacy of the two
preceding books; but it was generally admitted
that the book showed an advance in
the author's powers, particularly in his
power of vivid dialogue. In his first novel
Mr. Allen had written that "The simple,
rural, key-note of life is still the sweetest,"
and a change to another key-note, tremulous
with pathos and tragedy, surprised the
reading public; but the opinion that it was
likely to prove a stepping-stone to higher
things found general favor. Nor was this
opinion unsound, for "The Choir Invisible"
lifted its author for the time above the
heads of all his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Both here and in England the book fairly
leaped to success; both here and in England
it was praised almost unqualifiedly.
An American critic, writing of it, said:
"Mr. Allen stands to-day in the front rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of American novelists. 'The Choir Invisible'
will solidify a reputation already established
and bring into clear light his rare
gifts as an artist. For this latest story is
as genuine a work of art as has come from
an American hand." An English critic
noted that it was "highly praised, and with
reason." "It is written," he said, "with
singular delicacy, and has an old-world fragrance
which seems to come from the
classics we keep in lavender."</p>

<p>The book succeeded so immensely that
an attempt was made to dramatize it, but
the attempt failed. The atmosphere of the
book proved to be too ethereal, too spiritual,
for dramatization.</p>

<p>That "The Choir Invisible" solidified
Mr. Allen's reputation was demonstrated
by the eagerness of the demand for "The
Reign of Law." In some respects this is
Mr. Allen's greatest work: it reveals even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a deeper knowledge of nature than he ever
revealed before, and it deals more intimately
with things which have revolved around
his own career.</p>

<p>Fame has little to do with the sale of
books. If "The Kentucky Cardinal,"
"The Choir Invisible," and "The Reign
of Law" had not been sold by the thousands,
Mr. Allen's fame would still be of
more than transient quality. There is
nothing ephemeral about these stories:
they are, strictly speaking, a part of our
classical literature. The vividness of the
pictures will always be fresh and interesting.</p>

<p>Taking too literally Mr. Allen's remark
in "The Reign of Law" that Kentucky
University is a ruin and will always
remain a ruin, the reading public has
generally decided, we have found, that the
university, the author's alma mater, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
exist. It does exist, but, apparently, not in
the condition in which the author would
have it. Before "The Reign of Law" had
been long on the market, he and the president
of Kentucky University fell into a controversy
which makes an interesting chapter
in the academic side of the history of the
Blue Grass State.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen works slowly and carefully, as
may be inferred from the number and the
character of his books. And he lives
quietly, modestly. He is not in the least
given to the exploitation of his habits and
his manners, even so far as they may be connected
with his literary work. Little has ever
been heard of him by the thousands who
hurry to read his books, and who read them
only to praise him. Some time ago his
publishers issued a brochure dealing with
his career, and the vital facts contained in
it, if put together, would not cover more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
than twenty or thirty ordinary lines.</p>

<p>It should be said before ending, however,
that the author of "The Reign of Law" is
looked up to almost filially by the younger
writers of the middle West. They are
never weary of applauding him and of indicating,
publicly as well as privately, his
extraordinary reputation. Traces of his
style, notably as it appears in his Corot-like
pictures of nature, may be found in their
writings. Indeed, it is quite likely that
nothing would please one of these fine young
men more than to have it said of his work
that it resembles the masterly work of James
Lane Allen.</p>

<h2>THOMAS NELSON PAGE<a id="page"></a></h2>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span></i><span class="smcap">homas Nelson Page</span> first
came into national prominence
seventeen years ago through the
publication by <i>The Century Magazine</i> of the
short story called "Marse Chan." He
received eighty dollars for the story.</p>

<p>A few years ago, in conversation with
Mr. Frank G. Carpenter, the author related
the incidents which led to the writing
of "Marse Chan." At the bottom was a
letter which a friend had shown him.
"This letter," said Mr. Page, "was from
an illiterate girl in Georgia to her soldier
sweetheart. The letter was poorly written
and poorly spelled, but full of pathos.
The girl had, it seems, trifled with the man,
but after he had left for the war she had
realized her great love for him and written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to him. She wrote: 'I know I have treated
you mean. I ain't never done right with
you all the time. When you asked me to
marry you, I laughed, and said I wouldn't
have you, and it makes me cry to think you
are gone away to the war. Now, I want
you to know that I love you, and I want
you to git a furlow and come home and I'll
marry you.' With a few words of affection
the letter closed, but a postscript was
added: 'Don't come home without a furlow,
for unless you come home honorable I
won't marry you.' This letter was received
by the soldier only a few days before
the battle of Seven Pines, and after he was
shot it was found in his breast pocket, just
over his heart. The pathos of it struck me
so forcibly that out of it came the story of
'Marse Chan.'"</p>

<p>Thomas Nelson Page was thirty-one
when "Marse Chan" appeared, and at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
time his shingle was new outside his office
in Richmond. Mr. Page was born in Hanover
County, Virginia, on April 23, 1853,
and is consequently now in his forty-ninth
year. A description of the house in which
he was born&mdash;Oakland, it was called&mdash;may
be found in "Two Little Confederates."
On both sides he is a lineal descendant of
Gen. Thomas Nelson, one of the signers of
the Declaration of Independence. It has
been said that there is scarcely an old family
in all Virginia to which the author is not related
in some degree. One of his cousins is
the Princess Troubetskoy, Amélie Rives
before her marriage, whose first husband was
John Armstrong Chanler. At the time of
the birth of Thomas the Pages were comparatively
wealthy, but later, during the war,
they lost most of their wealth. Thomas's
first reading lessons, in the Waverley novels,
were given him by an aunt, who also taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
him to read the Episcopal prayer-book. His
education was interrupted by the outbreak of
the war, for his father accepted a commission
in the Confederate army. Occasionally
the boy visited his father in camp, when the
troops were on the road from Oakland to
Richmond. Once he witnessed a bombardment.
Happily, he was old enough to appreciate
the gossip of the war which passed
around the negro cabins.</p>

<p>Like all the slaveholders, the Pages were
much reduced in riches when the war
ended, but, nevertheless, at the age of sixteen,
Thomas was sent to Washington and
Lee University. Of his college days he
once said:</p>

<p>"My standing was not high. I don't know
that I had much ambition to be one of the
first honor men. At any rate, I got no
medals of any kind. I suppose I was a fair
average student, but I hear that I devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
myself more to outside reading than to my
studies. I was a member of the literary
society, and for a time was the editor of the
college paper. Contrary to the usual custom,
I wrote short articles instead of long
essays, and from this got the nick-name of
'The Short-Article Editor.' I wrote, I
suppose, much for the pleasure of seeing
myself in print. I was very bashful in
those days, and I know that I trembled
when I first got up to speak in the literary
society. I had a chum at college who is
now one of the most famous lawyers of the
country. He excels as a debater. He was
also bashful, and during our college days he
joined with me in a method of improving
our oratorical powers. We would get together
in a room, and, having closed the
doors, would debate with each other, upon
some question. One would stand on one
side of the table and one on the other and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
we would declaim away, each having a fifteen
minutes' speech and a like time for
answers. This practice helped me materially
in my work as a lawyer."</p>

<p>After his graduation from Washington
and Lee University, Mr. Page secured employment
as a teacher in a private school in
Kentucky, not far from Louisville. There
he taught for a year, and he says that he
enjoyed it very much. He kept his pen at
work steadily. The influential paper in
the part of the country where he was teaching,
was, of course, <i>The Louisville Courier-Journal</i>.
The young teacher was intensely
interested in Ik Marvel's books, and he
wrote some essays in imitation of Marvel
and sent them to the <i>Courier-Journal</i>.
They were rejected. From what he has
said since, their rejection was not a source
of much discouragement to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of a year the rebuffed essayist
returned to his home in Virginia, and,
soon after, deciding to study law, he entered
the law school of the University of Virginia.
Greatly to his credit, he got his degree in
a year. Meantime, however, he kept up
his interest in literature. While at the
University of Virginia he contributed to
the college paper. It was also his habit,
while at home, to write stories on slates
for the entertainment of his friends, and
erase the stories after he had read them.
At school, too, he began to write stories in
the negro dialect, and he continued this
practice in his law office in Richmond. At
his office he wrote the first of his works accepted
by the magazines, a poem called
"Unc' Gabe's White Folks," which was
published in <i>Scribner's</i> in 1876. He received
fifteen dollars for it. He was very
proud of that unpretentious check. Later
he wrote a historical article relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
centennial celebration in old Yorktown, and
then he sent out his first story, "Marse
Chan." It was paid for promptly, but,
like many another story sent to the magazines,
particularly stories from unknown
authors, it remained unpublished for several
years. Finally, overcome by impatience,
the author wrote to ascertain what had become
of it, and shortly afterward he received
a proof of it. With its publication in 1884
came instant popularity.</p>

<p>But at no time previous to his moving to
Washington was literature first in Page's
mind. In the beginning, at Richmond, he
wrote only at night, when his day's work
was done; and for a time he actually ceased
writing fiction entirely lest it might interfere
with the practice of his profession.
For, as a matter of fact, he has been a very
successful lawyer. Six months after he
had settled down in Richmond he was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to support himself with his earnings at the
bar, and during the eighteen years which
followed, that is, up to the time of his
settling down in Washington, his income
was chiefly from law.</p>

<p>So, it was some time before "Marse
Chan" was succeeded by "Meh Lady,"
"Unc' Edinburg's Drowndin'," "Polly"
and "Ole 'Stracted." It was said in those
days that the stories were like variations on
a single theme; but we are inclined to
agree with the critic who said: "For this
we feel no disposition to quarrel with Mr.
Page, being eager to hear the tale as often
as he may find ways to tell it, and grateful
to him for such beautiful and faithful
pictures of a society now become portion
and parcel of the irrevocable past." To
Mr. Page and his equally delightful contemporary,
Mr. Joel Chandler Harris, the
reading public is indebted for no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
number of the most charming features of
American literature.</p>

<p>It may please those who enjoy particulars
to know that the popular writer regards
"Unc' Edinburg's Drowndin'," which
was first to follow "Marse Chan," as his
best picture of Virginia life. Mr. Page, in
1886, married Miss Anne Seddon Bruce,
the daughter of Charles Bruce of Charlotte
County, Virginia, largely for whose entertainment
he had written his early stories;
and before the death of Mrs. Page in 1888
Mr. Page had written "Meh Lady" and
had published "In Ole Virginia," a collection
of his works, all in dialect.</p>

<p>In those days, by the way, his work was
often compared by the critics with the
work of Mr. Harris. Perhaps the fairest
comparison was made by Mr. Coleman,
who admired the two authors quite equally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Page," said the critic, "enjoys the
reputation of having written the most exquisite
story of the war that has yet
appeared ("Marse Chan"). In comparison
with the works of Joel Chandler
Harris, though both authors deal with the
negro, the one in no wise interferes with the
proper appreciation of the other. In Uncle
Remus Mr. Harris has given us the truer
insight into the character of the type to
which he belongs, while the venerable
family servant is somewhat idealized by
Mr. Page, and, moreover, is made to tell a
story possessing a value and interest of its
own not entirely dependent upon the personality
of the narrator and his race peculiarities.
In the matter of dialect, Mr. Page
has the advantage, though this may be due,
in part, to the difference between the Virginia
negro and his brother of Georgia."</p>

<p>The Virginian has portrayed the sweeter
side of the old slavery days, in direct contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to Mrs. Stowe's picture of the harsher
side. In the master he has delineated forbearance,
confidence, protection; in the
slave, respect, devotion and fidelity. Without
a scruple he has felt constrained to make
one of his characters say of the days before
the war: "Dem wuz good ole times, marster&mdash;de
bes' Sam ever see! De wuz, in
fac'! Niggers did n' hed nothin' 't all to
do&mdash;jes' hed to 'ten' to de feedin' an'
cleanin' de hosses, an' doin' what de
marster tell 'em to do; an' when dey wuz
sick, dey had things sent 'em out de house,
an' de same doctor came to see 'em whar
'ten' to de white folks when dey wuz po'ly.
Dyah war n' no trouble nor nuthin."</p>

<p>A few years ago Mr. Page was asked if
he wrote rapidly. "Yes and no," he replied.
"I write the first draft as rapidly
as I can and then go over it very carefully
in the revision. I try to simplify my writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
as much as possible. The more simple
it is, I think, the better it is. I find, however,
that the revision often takes away the
spirit from the first draft. I lay away the
manuscript, and looking at it several weeks
later, I can see that the first draft is truer
to nature than the more stilted revision. I
think I do more careful work now than
I have done in the past. My ideal is far
above anything I have ever done, and I
sometimes despair of approaching it. There
is one thing I do, however, which I think
is a good plan for any writer. That is, I
always give the best I have in me to the
story which I am writing. I do not save
anything which I think might perhaps be
of use to me in the future. The cream, if
you could use that expression, always goes
to the present."</p>

<p>In 1891 the author of "Marse Chan"
left Richmond and went to New York to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
succeed Charles Dudley Warner in the
conduct of "The Drawer" in <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, Mr. Warner succeeding Mr. Howells,
who at that time left <i>Harper's</i> for the
<i>Cosmopolitan</i>, in the conduct of "The
Study." That same year Mr. Page appeared
as a public reader. Two years
later he married Mrs. Henry Field of
Chicago, a granddaughter of Governor
Barbour of Virginia, and since then, for the
most part, he has lived and worked in
Washington. By far his most ambitious
work is "Red Rock," a novel which has
done much to affect favorably the old attitude
of the North toward the South.</p>

<p>Not many of our writers rest their fame
on fewer works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<h2>RICHARD HARDING DAVIS<a id="davis"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">great</span> many persons, indeed, a
great many critics, have called
Richard Harding Davis superficial.
They obviously had one thing in mind
and said another. Perhaps they may have
meant to say that sometimes Mr. Davis
dealt in superficialities. We lean toward
Professor Harry Thurston Peck's opinion.
"Mr. Davis, in fact," he says, "because
of the predominance in him of the journalistic
motive, is a photographer rather than
an artist; but he is a very skillful and
adept photographer."</p>

<p>No person of superficial temperament
could have described with so much humor
Van Bibber's attempt to practice economy,
or could have given us the affecting conclusion
of "Princess Aline," or could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
written many paragraphs of "The Exiles."
No sympathetic human being who has ever
read "The Exiles" will forget the picture
of the outlawed boodle alderman in Tangier,
saying to a visitor about to return to New
York with a clean conscience and a strong
hunger to see the familiar sights:</p>

<p>"'I'll tell you what you <i>can</i> do for me,
Holcombe. Some night I wish you would go
down to Fourteenth Street, some night this
spring, when the boys are sitting out on the
steps in front of the Hall, and just take a
drink for me at Ed. Lally's; just for luck.
Will you? That's what I'd like to do. I
don't know nothing better than Fourteenth
Street of a summer evening, with all the
people crowding into Pastor's, on one side of
the Hall, and the Third Avenue L-cars running
by on the other. That's a gay sight,
ain't it now? With all the girls coming
in and out of Theiss's, and the sidewalks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217</a></span>
crowded. One of them warm nights when
they have to have the windows open, and
you can hear the music in at Pastor's, and
the audience clapping their hands. That's
great, isn't it? Well,' he laughed and
shook his head, 'I'll be back there some
day, won't I,' he said, wistfully, 'and hear
it for myself?'"</p>

<p>It would be hard to find in fiction a more
affecting picture done with fewer strokes
and with closer fidelity to human nature.
It is a picture which must strike the attentive
reader, and particularly the attentive
New York reader, full on the heart strings.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis has the habit of looking at
the odd things in life. Without this habit
no man can be a first-class reporter; and
our author has proved himself a first-class
reporter in many parts of the world and
for many papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Like every well-trained reporter, Mr.
Davis is continually "seeing things." As
he said to his friend Mr. Sangree, some
months ago: "I never walk one city block
that I do not see twenty things to interest
me. I tire my friends sometimes by pointing
them out. Their minds run in different
channels. But this ability to see things
is my greatest joy in life, incidentally my
living. I cultivated it when I began reporting,
and to this day if I see a man turn
in a car to look out the window I unconsciously
turn with him. He may have
observed something that escaped me&mdash;something
that contains an element of
human interest, and I hold no effort wasted
that may add to this general cargo of life's
impressions."</p>

<p>No able reporter could have worked long
under Charles A. Dana and escaped the objective
habit. In fact, a story which Mr.
Sangree tells of his friend's experience on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<i>The Evening Sun</i> illustrates the point.</p>

<p>"At eight o' clock one spring morning,"
says Mr. Sangree, "the blotter at police
headquarters recorded a trifling fire on the
East Side. News being dull, Davis was
sent to cover it. He found a rickety tenement
house in which fire had little more
than singed the top floor. The crowd had
left, a few ashes were smouldering, and the insurance
adjusters were examining the place.</p>

<p>"'Nothing here,' said the policeman on
watch. 'Only five hundred dollars damage
and a bum lodger asphyxiated. He's in
that room.'</p>

<p>"The reporters peeped, saw the blackened
face and rigid form, a man unnamed and
forgotten&mdash;and wrote a paragraph. <i>The
Evening Sun</i> reporter, in mousing about
saw an alarm clock by the dead man's side
with the hand pointing to seven o' clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What time did you break in here?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'Let me see,' yawned the bluecoat;
'Seven o' clock it was. I remember because
that alarm was going off just as I got
inside.'</p>

<p>"'That's my story,' said Davis, and he
began his account, touching and vivid, simply
with: 'The man died at six-thirty.
The alarm went off at seven. It was just
half an hour too late.'"</p>

<p>"What impressed me," said the author,
discussing the story subsequently, "was
that impotent alarm clock jangling away
when the owner was dead. A man's existence
had been cut off because that fifty-cent
clock could not give its alarm a few minutes
earlier."</p>

<p>This illustrates what was meant when we
said that Mr. Davis takes an objective view
of life. His experience as a reporter was
invaluable to him; and he took Dr. Hale's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
advice, and ended the experience at the
right time. Doubtless many good writers
have been spoiled by indulging too long in
the fascinations of newspaper work.</p>

<p>A large part of his training as a reporter
the creator of Van Bibber obtained in
his native city, during his service on the
<i>Philadelphia Press</i>, for which paper he
went to work when he was a little more
than twenty. There is a portrait of him
taken at the age of twenty-three, in the
disguise in which he worked while getting
the information which drove the nest of
thieves out of Wood street.</p>

<p>While Davis was working for the <i>Philadelphia
Press</i>, by the way, he and his
associates in the reporters' room fell in love
with one of Stevenson's thrilling short
stories, "A Lodging for the Night." They
could not restrain their admiration; so they
wrote an enthusiastic letter to the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sick man off there in Samoa. And to the
spokesman of the admiring crew Stevenson
replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<i>Dear Sir:</i><br /></p>

<p>Why, thank you very much for your frank,
agreeable and natural letter. It is certainly
very pleasant that all you young fellows
wholly enjoy my work, and get some good
out of it; and it was very kind in you to
write and tell me so. The tale of the suicide
is excellently droll; and your letter, you
may be sure, will be preserved. If you are
to escape, unhurt, out of your present business,
you must be very careful, and you must
find in your heart much constancy. The
swiftly done work of the journalist, and the
cheap finish and ready-made methods to
which it leads, you must try to counteract in
private by writing with the most considerate
slowness and on the most ambitious models.
And when I say 'writing'&mdash;O, believe me,
it is re-writing that I have chiefly in my
mind. If you will do this I hope to hear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
you some day.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Please excuse this sermon from</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Your obliged</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter, brought to light a short while
ago by Mr. Sangree, in a magazine article,
discloses an exchange of sentiments creditable
to all the correspondents concerned.</p>

<p>For a time the promising journalist was
overmastered by an ambition to be an
editor, and he established a short-lived dramatic
periodical called <i>The Stage</i>. In
1889 he reported the Johnstown flood for
a Philadelphia paper, and then, the following
summer, went abroad with the All-Philadelphia
cricket team. Upon his
return to this country, New York charmed
him, and there, for the most part, he has
lived ever since. At first he was connected
with <i>The Evening Sun</i>. During this connection
he wrote his delightful "Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Bibber" stories. But these were not his
first stories. His first stories were written
while he was editor of a paper at Lehigh
College, in his student days. The stories
numbered about a dozen, and Mr. Davis
collected them and paid ninety dollars to
have them published in book form. The
book has scarcely ever been heard of since.
Later, while at Johns Hopkins University,
he wrote his first accepted story, "Richard
Carr's Baby," a sort of foot-ball tale,
which was published in St. Nicholas.
However, the "Van Bibber" stories were
his first work of any serious account; they
were the first work to bring him popularity.</p>

<p>After the "Van Bibber" sketches came
his most sparkling gem, "Gallegher," a
newspaper story which was refused by
three editors and then published, with immediate
success, in <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Later appeared in quick succession "The
Other Woman," "An Unfinished Story,"
"My Disreputable Friend, Mr. Raegan,"
and the other short stories which soon
made their author's name familiar to the
reading public on both sides of the ocean.</p>

<p>In 1890 Davis became editor of <i>Harper's
Weekly</i>. This position he left a year or
so later to travel across the continent, with
"The West Through a Car Window" as
the result. Then he went to London, and
described the life there; and then he went
to Egypt and wrote "The Rulers of the
Mediterranean." He was now fairly well
started; and since then his pen has never
been idle.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Davis's advent as a serious
writer of fiction he has been subjected on
one side to the most extravagant praise and
on the other to the most merciless censure.
The critics on both sides have made matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
worse by dropping the subject at hand and
bringing out for public inspection vast
quantities of personal anecdotes about the
unfortunate author, most of which stories
are probably apocryphal. In fact, at one
time the newspaper comments were so
vulgar that the helpless victim said to a
friend who visited him in New York: "If
I thought I was like the man the newspapers
make me out to be, I would not
only cut my own acquaintance; I'd cut my
own throat." But, so far as the public
ever found out, he took the slings and
arrows philosophically. He could afford to.
One by one his new works have prospered.</p>

<p>It was at the height of this hypercritical
hostility that, in 1897, Davis was suddenly
missed. About the same time the stories
in the <i>London Times</i> on the war between
Turkey and Greece began to attract universal
attention. The <i>Times</i>, said one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the New York newspapers, which had
shown especial bitterness toward its former
reporter, has discovered a brilliant war
correspondent. It seemed that people all
over the world were asking, Who is he?
It was Mr. Davis, proving, under the cloak
of the <i>Times'</i> traditional anonymity his
right to be respected as a descriptive writer
of the first quality. He repeated this success
the next year in Cuba, during the
Spanish war, when his extraordinary skill
in the description of picturesque incidents
was favored by the circumstance that the
generals and admirals themselves were
sending home virtually all the news.</p>

<p>When, last year, Mr. Davis went to
South Africa it was commonly expected
that he would take sides with the British.
Never was public expectation more emphatically
at fault. In a moment he took the
measure of the British cause and the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
tactics; both of these things disgusted
him. He put Mr. Kipling himself to
shame by serving "the God of Things as
They Are"; and as a result he forfeited
many friendships which he had made in
England. But he won the hearts of his
countrymen. His courageous honesty destroyed
in this country the last vestige of
captious hostility.</p>

<p>To-day, at the age of thirty-eight, just at
the entrance to full-blown life, Mr. Davis
is widely admired and honored. He has
pleased the light-hearted with his pretty
romantic tales, and he has satisfied the
strong of heart with his many examples of
an unerring sense of the true comedy and
the true pathos of life, and, moreover, of
his remarkable personal fearlessness. Perhaps
the term which a friend applied to
him is most fitting&mdash;perhaps he may best
be called a "sublimated reporter"; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
your sublimated reporter must be at once
an imperturbable philosopher and an artist
holding the mirror up to nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The author's marriage to Miss Cecil
Clark of Chicago, at Marion, Massachusetts,
on May 4, 1899, was an event remarkable
for its jollity. Last year Mrs. Davis accompanied
her husband to South Africa.
She is said to be as skillful with the pencil
as he is with the pen.</p>

<h2>JOHN KENDRICK BANGS<a id="bangs"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">dozen</span> years or so ago, when
Mr. Bangs faced at home an audience,
which had gathered to hear
his address on "The Evolution of the
Humorist," he said:</p>

<p>"I was born in and have resided in
Yonkers for a number of years; I have
braved the perils of life in this community,
and have endured, without a murmur, the
privations common to all of us."</p>

<p>A modest biography, and withal an illustration
of Mr. Bangs's philosophy. He
takes things as they come&mdash;and leaves his
imprint on them. Comparisons of skill
aside, no man could do more.</p>

<p>John Kendrick Bangs was born in
Yonkers, New York, in May, 1862. His
father, Francis N. Bangs, was a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
New York lawyer, in fact, one of the most
prominent lawyers the New York bar has
ever known. His grandfather was the
Rev. Nathan Bangs, D.D., the first historian
of the Methodist Church in this
country, the first editor of a Methodist
paper, and for many years president of
Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut.</p>

<p>In 1883, after receiving such an education
as any New York boy of a well-to-do
New York family receives, young Bangs
was graduated with the degree of Bachelor
of Philosophy from the School of Political
Science of Columbia University, New York.
For a year and a half afterward he studied
law in his father's office&mdash;studied at
"long range," as he has said himself. But
all the time he was impatient to go into
literature. "I was more of a fighter," he
says, "and it seemed to me that a man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
enough battles of his own to wage without
rushing after the battles of other people."
Gradually his inherited fondness for literature
smothered his zeal as a student of law.
While contributing in his undergraduate
days to the college paper, <i>Acta Columbiana</i>,
he had enjoyed a taste of literary glory.
So, between dips into his father's dry
volumes, he wrote little sketches in his
characteristic vein. These tentative works
introduced him favorably to the managers
of <i>Life</i>, and, late in 1884, he became associated
with Mr. Mitchell in the editorship
of that entertaining periodical. In addition
to his editorial work he undertook to
maintain the attractive "By the Way"
page, and to this valuable feature of <i>Life</i>
he contributed an extraordinary amount of
original matter. What would not have
been asked of many other men was requested
of the new humorist in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
casual manner, for he quickly proved that,
besides possessing a keen literary instinct
and that kindly and delightful insight into
human nature which, brought together,
double the value of a comic paper, he also
possessed remarkable energy and power of
application.</p>

<p>In 1887, while still connected with <i>Life</i>,
and shortly after his marriage, young
Bangs went abroad, and during this absence
from editorial work his first book,
"Roger Camorden, a Strange Story," was
published. It was an unusual and very
promising tale of hallucination, and its
success was encouraging. That same year,
in collaboration with his friend and classmate,
Frank Dempster Sherman, he produced
a series of satirical and humorous
pieces, which were put into a volume under
the title of "New Waggings of old Tales."
Soon afterward he resigned from <i>Life</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in order to devote more time to larger
work.</p>

<p>The first product of the rising author's
independent career was a travesty on "The
Taming of the Shrew" called "Katherine,"
which he wrote for a dramatic association
connected with the Seventh Regiment of
the New York National Guard. It followed
the Shakespearean construction
rather closely, and, with its many quips and
gags and jolly songs, made a first-rate
libretto for a comic opera. The popularity
of the travesty advertised the fame of
Bangs from one end of Manhattan Island
to the other. The following year, for the
same organization, he wrote another travesty,
"Mephistopheles, a Profanation";
and this, too, won much popularity and
further brightened its author's name.</p>

<p>The happy results of his experience as
the father of three boys were noticeable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the book which Mr. Bangs published in
1891, "Tiddledywink Tales," the first of
a series of amusing stories for children.
The other divisions of this series are "In
Camp with a Tin Soldier," "The Tiddledywink
Poetry Book," and "Half Hours with
Jimmie-Boy," books that have endeared
their author to half the grown-up children
in the land. It was by means of these
books that he became a most welcome contributor
to Harper's Round Table and to
the juvenile departments of various literary
syndicates. A novel, "Toppleton's Client,"
appeared in 1893, and in that year also appeared
his first widely successful work,
"Coffee and Repartee," a collection of
Idiot papers, which has been described, and
with good reason, as a mixture of Oliver
Wendell Holmes and Bill Nye. Those
were not, compared with the present time,
enthusiastic literary days, and yet in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
years fifty thousand copies of the little
book were sold. "Coffee and Repartee"
was followed at regular intervals by "The
Water-Ghost," "The Idiot," "Mr. Bonaparte
of Corsica," and by the other books
whose names have at some time, been on
every liberal reader's tongue.</p>

<p>One of the most entertaining of the
New Yorker's books is "Ten Weeks in
Politics," behind the writing of which is a
story worth telling. In 1894 Mr. Bangs
was nominated by the Democrats for Mayor
of Yonkers. "No candidate, I sincerely
believe," says his friend Mr. Corbin, "ever
entered a political campaign with greater
seriousness or with a more strenuous desire
to devote himself to the public good; and
except for any one of half a dozen accidents
he would have been elected. To
begin with, one of the cleverest of New
York newspapers, the editorial policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which has been suspected of personal prejudice,
appeared to bear a grudge against
Mr. Bangs, and persecuted him in prose
and in verse with the implication that he
was making a farce of politics. But the
real cause of his defeat, as he explains
with a quiet smile, was the fact that he
refused one midnight to turn his house into
a beer garden for the benefit of a local
German band that serenaded him; and in
point of fact the votes of the musicians
and their heelers were enough to turn the
scale. Though Mr. Bangs is always willing
to laugh at the figure he cut as a
politician, he has never lost the sense of
his duty as a citizen. His victorious rival
had the magnanimity, which in such cases
is scarcely to be distinguished from political
wisdom, to offer him a subordinate
position in his administration&mdash;on the
Board of Education, I think. Mr. Bangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
had the magnanimity, which could not
have contained the least scruple of policy,
to accept the position and to fill it to the
best of his ability, even while he was
writing his 'Ten Weeks in Politics.'
This episode is thoroughly characteristic."</p>

<p>Mr. Bangs has spoken of that defeat as
the greatest blessing that he ever met.
"In later years," he says, "when I saw
how I would have been forced to abandon
my chosen profession for politics, when I
learned that the mayoralty would have
taken every moment of my time, I was
glad that I had been defeated. I saw, for
the first time, the truth in the saying that
a man can do more to bring success within
his grasp by standing by his original proposition,
even if it be a humorous one. And
politics and humor do not mix, unless you
happen to be a cartoonist."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Politics and humor mix well enough in
the right man; but it is not to be doubted
that literature has been the gainer by the
result of that election in Yonkers. The
defeated candidate would probably have
made an excellent Mayor. He certainly
would have made a conscientious Mayor;
and by reason of this conscientiousness the
reading public would have missed books
which have made us certain that Mr.
Bangs is a gifted humorist.</p>

<p>Mr. Corbin, by the way, tells another
interesting story of his friend's characteristic
activity. "Once when I went to
Yonkers," says Mr. Corbin, "he appeared
as the proprietor of a livery stable. He
explained that the business had been running
down when he took it, and that by
charging himself a thousand or two a year
for cab hire he was making a 'go' of it;
and that moreover, as he paid his account
to himself it did not cost him anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ride. The plain fact seemed to be that
his ready purse and his business sense had
saved a humble neighbor from misfortune."</p>

<p>Before closing the political chapter of
Mr. Bangs's career it may prove interesting
to quote from a "send-off" which a
Yonkers paper gave him on March 10,
1894, just before the German band episode.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bangs," it said, "is a Democrat
of the strictest kind, and can always be
relied upon to care for and advance the interests
of his party, while at the same time
he will so guard and guide the municipal
ship as to avoid the rocks of reckless expenditure,
and pass safely into the harbor
of wise economy. With such a candidate
the Democracy believes it can surely recapture
the mayoralty, and at the same
time secure for the city a young, able, and
in all respects a competent, honest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
faithful chief magistrate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bangs is popular in the club life
of the city, being a member of the old
Palisade Boat Club and the Yonkers Lawn
Tennis Club. In the latter he is the
Chairman of the Entertainment Committee,
and also a member of the Building and
Book Committees. He is not only one of
the best lawn tennis players in the club,
but in the alleys of the boat club has
proved himself a skillful bowler, having
figured conspicuously in the recent annual
tournament. He recently proved himself
a public speaker of no mean order when he
delivered his lecture on 'The Evolution of
the Humorist from Adam to Bill Nye,' for
a charitable object. He also took prominent
part in the last charity ball, which is
the social event of the season in this city."</p>

<p>How that catalogue of social and athletic
qualifications must have appealed to a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the victim's sense of humor!</p>

<p>Mr. Bangs takes his own medicine. He
firmly believes that humor sweetens life.
"Show me a man who does not appreciate
humor," he said once, "and I will show
you a man who is morbid, cynical, unresponsive
to every fine impulse of nature.
Such a man is worse than a pessimist, and
more to be pitied. Take some of the
greatest and most successful men in the
world. Humor has always played an important
part in their lives. Often a funny
incident has marked the turning-point of a
great man's career; often some ridiculous
position has been the impetus of a new
start in life. Humor is as necessary to
the home as is the cooking stove. I mean
good, healthy humor. It eases the mind
and it becomes an educator; it fills and
makes pleasant many a long night; it
gives encouragement to the wanderer; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
relieves the tired mother of the burden of
her cares; it encourages men and women
to look on the bright side of life, and the
bright side is the only side which should
be exposed to view. Literature is the best
vehicle of humor. In literature it lives
the longest, and in literature it can be
studied and appreciated to the best advantage.
Someone has said that literature
robs humor of its spontaneity! A mistake!
A great mistake! A good, solid humorous
book, or passage in a book, can be appreciated
a hundred times over. The mind
retains fun longer than it retains cold
facts. You will hear a man repeat something
funny that he read, years after, when
he couldn't, for his life, tell you the rudiments
of the mathematical problems which
he spent years in trying to master. A
good man looks upon a good book as a
friend. He goes to it for consolation whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
he feels blue and sullen, whenever
nostalgia claims him as her own. How
quickly do the careworn, the tired, the
strugglers, the successful ones as well, find
rest in the realms of humor!"</p>

<p>In the course of his busy life&mdash;to give
some facts not to be found in the Yonkers
eulogy&mdash;Mr. Bangs has been vestryman of
a church, a purchaser of books for a public
library, a journalist, and a director of a
private school. At present he is giving
brilliant service as editor of <i>Harper's
Weekly</i>. Meantime, his pen, or his typewriter,
is not idle at home, as the publication
a few months ago of "The Idiot at
Home" attests.</p>

<h2>HAMLIN GARLAND<a id="garland"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">H</span></i><span class="smcap">amlin Garland</span> is Western
in every sense of that broad term.
To him the West has been birthplace,
playground, battlefield. Not only
as a writer but also as a man he takes that
far-seeing, keen, sincere, unconventional
view of things in general that distinguishes
the thoroughbred Westerner. Like Jim
Matteson, the hero of his latest novel, he
sympathizes with the elements. He might
appear to be at home in an Eastern drawing-room,
but we think that he would prefer
to live in his own country.</p>

<p>There might be some dissent from the
opinion that he is the foremost of our
Western novelists; but there can hardly
be any dissent from the opinion that he occupies
an unique place in American literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
for not only has he sounded a new,
vibrant, resonant chord in our literature,
but he also has been our one fearless and
unchangeable literary impressionist. "I
believe," he said once, to illustrate his rule
of work, "that the beauty disease has been
the ruin of much good literature. It leads
to paint and putty&mdash;to artificiality. If a
thing is beautiful, well and good; but I do
not believe in an artist using literary varnish
in writing of sordid things. He can
discover the beauty in sordid lives not by
varnishing them, but by sympathetic interpretation
of them."</p>

<p>The West has been his birthplace and
his playground. He was born in the beautiful
La Crosse Valley, Wisconsin, in September,
1860. His parents were of Scotch
Presbyterian stock, which fact, together
with his early environment, must account
for his radical and aggressive mental outfit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
"My dear old parents," he says,
"brought me up like a Spartan soldier.
I owe so much to my mother; to the
goodness and patient sympathy with which
she trained and softened my blustering
boyish nature." If you look at the dedication
of "Main-Travelled Roads" you
will find an echo of this eulogy: "To
my father and mother, whose half-century
pilgrimage on the main-travelled road of
life has brought them only trial and deprivation,
this book is dedicated by a son to
whom every day brings a deepening sense
of his parents' silent heroism." This appreciation
of his parents' more than dutiful
sacrifices constantly finds expression in the
author's work; it is a salient feature of his
individuality.</p>

<p>Seven years after his birth the family
moved to Winneshiek County, Iowa, a spot
typical of the primeval West; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
here that Garland first got the vivid impressions
of nature which he has so successfully
pictured in his stories. There is,
for instance, in "Up the Coulé," a little
picture worthy of Millet.</p>

<p>"A farm in the valley. Over the mountains
swept jagged, gray, angry, sprawling
clouds, sending a freezing, thin drizzle of
rain, as they passed, upon a man following
a plough. The horses had a sullen and weary
look, and their manes and tails streamed
sideways in the blast. The ploughman,
clad in a ragged gray coat, with uncouth,
muddy boots upon his feet, walked with
his head inclined toward the sleet to shield
his face from the cold and sting of it. The
soil rolled away, black and sticky, with a
dull sheen upon it. Near by, a boy with
tears on his cheeks was watching cattle,
a dog seated near, his back to the gale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>But did Garland take any part in
such experiences? He did, indeed. "I
ploughed seventy acres of land when I was
ten years old," he says, "and more each
year after that. I was so small that I had
to reach up to catch hold of the handles of
the plough, but I did it. I can remember
well how I felt when I started out for my
first ploughing in the spring. My muscles
were then tender, my feet sank down into
the soil, throwing my weight on the ankles
and the tendons of the feet. By the end
of the first day I was almost ready to drop
with pain, but I had to go on. And how
my bones did ache the next morning when
I was called to go to work! I worked
right along, however, going to school in
the winter until I was fifteen."</p>

<p>But not all the work was at the plough.
With his brother Frank he worked out on
the prairies, sometimes herding cattle,
sometimes scouting for the neighbors. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
somewhere, we believe, the author
has said that almost half his life has been
spent in the meadows and on horseback.
Many recollections of these days are to be
found in "Prairie Songs," which book, in
fact, is almost a complete reflection of his
boyhood days. And on the prairies, too,
he met the grangers,&mdash;we use the word in
its dignified sense&mdash;"those incessant toilers
who experience, in all its bareness, the
rough and bitter side of the great 'main-travelled
road.'"</p>

<p>But the school in which he got the bulk
of his education was Cedarville Academy,
in Mitchell County, just a little westward
from his home. There he made a special
study of history and English composition;
and there, for the first time in his life, he
had the use of a library. He was graduated
from the academy at the age of
twenty-one. The following two years he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spent teaching and lecturing in the East.</p>

<p>The list of the subjects of his lectures
show us the breadth of mind which he had
reached just as he entered citizenhood; it
attests, too, his remarkable intellectual energy
and his sympathy with his times.
These are some of the literary topics: The
Transcendentalists, Emerson and Thoreau;
The Balladists, with readings from Whittier,
Longfellow and Holmes; Walt Whitman,
the Prophet of the New Age; The
Epic of the Age, the Novel, the American
Novel; Americanism in the Novel, with
reference to William Dean Howells and
Henry James; The Pioneers, Bret Harte
and Joaquin Miller; Some Representative
Names, Joseph Kirkland, E. W. Howe,
George W. Cable, Joel Chandler Harris,
Miss Murfree, Miss Baylor, Miss Wilkins,
Miss Jewett, Rose Terry Cooke; the City
in Fiction and the Drama; The Future of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Poetry and Fiction; The Art of Edwin
Booth; Shakespeare and Browning.</p>

<p>There is something truly Western in the
fact that Garland was attracted to Dakota
by the land boom of 1883. He soon
learned, however, that the boom was not
for him; indeed, his only profit from it was
experience.</p>

<p>In 1884, consequently, he took up the
study of English literature in the Boston
Public Library. He had intended to take
a course in literature and oratory at some
college, preliminary to returning to the
West to teach. But it is significant of
his mental make-up that he found college
methods "too scholastic and too dry," and,
in general, opposed to his own convictions.
This brings to mind what a man who met
him early in the nineties said: "It would
be impossible for any conventional critic
to kill Mr. Garland with scholarly criticism;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
he has a buoyancy of indifference to
obstacles as free as a cyclone from one of
his own Iowa prairies; he would joyously
tell the most learned professors of Harvard
College that the universities as at present
conducted in America are the bulwarks of
conservatism and the foes of progress; the
people who hear him talk about realism
and naturalism and truth usually confess
an exhilaration at 'finding someone now-a-days'
who believes the things he does believe
with most consuming fervor."</p>

<p>Naturally his unconventional method of
studying English literature had an unusual
result. To quote from remarks that he
made in Boston a few years ago: "The
whole perspective of English literature
changed with me. Chaucer was no longer
great simply because someone had said
that he was; Crabbe was not dry because
some professor of English literature had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
said so. I went into the philosophic development
of English literature from the
earliest myth, through the drama&mdash;which,
by the way, I found to be a continuous
chain, and not a miracle&mdash;up to distinctively
modern literature. Throughout, I
gave to my reading a modern man's comments.
If I didn't like an author's work
I didn't try to like it. So, you see, after
all, my work in the library was mainly a
process fitting me for teaching."</p>

<p>But all the time, as a matter of fact, he
was moving farther away from the teacher's
desk. As he studied American literature
it occurred to him that the Western side
of it might be still further developed.
That side certainly lacked anything corresponding
to his fresh and deep impressions
of it. It was only a step from the
thought to the deed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harper's Weekly</i> published his first poem,
"Lost in the Norther," a description of a
man lost in a blizzard, and paid him twenty-five
dollars for it. With characteristic
generosity, he spent the money on his parents,
buying a copy of Grant's "Memoirs"
for his father and a silk dress for his
mother. His mother, too, by the way, received
half the money paid for his first bit
of fiction. This is the story that Garland
told in Washington five or six years ago:</p>

<p>"I had been studying in Boston for
several years, when I went out to Dakota
to visit my parents. The night after I
arrived I was talking with mother about
old times and old friends. She told me
how one family had gone to New York for
a visit and had returned only too happily
to their Western home. As she told the
story the pathos of it struck me. I went
into another room and began to write.
The story was one of the best chapters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
my book 'Main-Travelled Roads.' I read
it to mother, and she liked it, and upon
telling her that I thought it was worth at
least seventy-five dollars she replied: 'Well,
if that is so I think you ought to divvy with
me, for I gave you the story.' 'I will,' said
I, and so when I got my seventy-five dollars
I sent her a check for half. I got many
good suggestions during that trip to Dakota.
I wrote poems and stories. Some
of the stories were published in <i>The Century
Magazine</i>, and I remember that I received
six hundred dollars within two
weeks from its editors. It was perhaps a
year later before I published my first
book."</p>

<p>This first book is "Main-Travelled
Roads," which by some is still regarded
as his best book. During the past ten
years he has been almost restlessly busy
with novels, poems, essays, and plays, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
all of which there is more or less evidence
of his magnificent unconventionality.</p>

<p>For if there be anything magnificently
unconventional in American literature it
is such works as "A Spoil of Office" and
"Crumbling Idols." "I am," said Garland,
in a letter written in 1891, "an impressionist,
perhaps, rather than a realist.
I believe, with Monet, that the artist should
be self-centred, and should paint life as he
sees it. If the other fellow doesn't see the
violet shadows on the road, so much the
worse for him. A whole new world of
color is opening to the eyes of the present
generation, exemplifying again that all
beauty, all mystery, is under our spread
hand&mdash;waiting to be grasped. I believe,
also, that there is the same wealth of color-mystery
in the facts of our daily lives, and
that within a single decade a race of dramatists
and novelists will demonstrate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
truth of my inference."</p>

<p>The decade has come and gone, but the
new race of dramatists and novelists is
still absent. Mr. Garland is even now far
ahead of the crowd.</p>

<p>He once described his manner of working
to Mr. Walter Blackburn Harte, another
radical, but not so fortunate, thinker.
He said that he never writes under pressure.
"I work precisely as some painters
do. I have unfinished pictures lying
around my workshop. After breakfast
each morning I go into my writing-room,
and whichever picture chimes in with my
mood, after a glance around, claims me for
that morning. I work on it as long as I
find great pleasure in it, and I stop the
moment I am conscious of it becoming a
grind. If I have any power left, I turn
to something else; if not, I quit and turn
to recreation&mdash;reading, study; or I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
out for a walk. I do all my writing on
blocks of manuscript paper, and I have
stacks of these lying around, as many as
forty or fifty in various stages of completion.
I never write on any one thing day
after day just with the purpose of getting
it done. I believe thoroughly in moods,
although I do not wait for any particular
mood, for I am in the mood every morning
for something. All my work interests
me supremely, or I should not do it."</p>

<p>Mr. Garland was married a few years
ago to Miss Zuleme Taft, of Chicago, who
has achieved some fame as a sculptor.</p>

<h2>PAUL LEICESTER FORD<a id="ford"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">I</span></i><span class="smcap">n</span> 1876, when Paul Leicester Ford
was eleven years old, he published
"The Webster Genealogy," a genealogy
of Noah Webster, with notes and
corrections of his own. When he was
seventeen he published "Websteriana, a
catalogue of books by Noah Webster, collated
from the library of Gordon L. Ford."
At nineteen he also became the author of
"Bibliotheca Chaunciana: a list of the writings
of Charles Chauncy," the second president
of Harvard College.</p>

<p>So much, at least, Ford accomplished before
he was out of his 'teens. Yet, considering
his environment, this record is not a
matter of wonder. Ford's father was Gordon
L. Ford, a successful lawyer, a diligent
student of American history, and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
great Greeley's day, publisher of the <i>New
York Tribune</i>; and, which is more to the
point, the collector and owner of one of the
largest and richest private libraries in the
United States. Little beyond these facts
is known by those who had not the privilege
of Gordon Ford's acquaintance.
Mr. Lindsay Swift speaks of him as "an
idealist of the type which does not readily
pursue other than the highest ends, and
which cannot throw open the reserves of
its nature."</p>

<p>Paul was born on March 23, 1865. On
his mother's side he is descended from
Governor Bradford of Plymouth Colony,
the author of the precious manuscript in
the State House at Boston. On this side,
too, he is the great-great-great-grandson of
the aforementioned Chauncy and the great-grandson
of the aforementioned Webster,
the lexicographer, and the grandson of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Professor Fowler of Amherst College.
Paul's brother, Worthington Chauncy
Ford, by the way, is already famous,
though in a quieter way, as a statistician
and publicist.</p>

<p>Paul was a delicate child; his very
delicacy gave him the opportunity to cultivate,
under extremely favorable circumstances,
his endowment of strong mental
faculties. He was educated in his father's
library. It is said that the Ford house,
which stood in Clark Street, Brooklyn, was
fairly walled with books. At the time
these books were transferred to the New
York Public Library their number was
given out as one hundred thousand. The
library itself was a room some fifty feet
square. There the Ford boys were educated
under the supervision of their cultured
parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Ford is by nature a student; and under
his father's guidance this disposition was
sedulously cultivated. As a child he
learned to set type, and as a child, also,
he assisted his father in historiographical
work. The father and the two sons established
the Historical Printing Club,
issuing books and pamphlets relating to
American history and bibliography. This
club was maintained until after the father's
death. Among its products were the
papers to which we have already referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay Swift has written an interesting
description of the famous bibliographical
arena in which Ford developed his
genius. The description, of course antedates
the memorable transfer. The room,
"over fifty feet square, and reached from
the main floor by a short flight of steps,"
he says, "is well but not glaringly lighted
by a lantern at the top, while the sides,
with the exception of a few small windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of no great utility owing to the tallness of
surrounding buildings, are fully taken up
with books to the height of eight feet. The
floor is covered in part by large rugs; the
walls and ceilings are of serious tint; a fireplace
is opposite the entrance; while sofas
of most dissimilar pattern and meant seemingly
to hold any burden but a human one,
are placed 'disposedly' about; chairs, easy
but not seductive, are in plenty, but like
the sofas give notice that here is a government
not of men but of books&mdash;here is no
library built for the lust of the flesh and
pride of the eye, but for books and for those
who use them. I cannot suppose that those
smitten of bibliophily would thrill over the
Ford library, since it exists for the practical
and virile, although it is, in parts, exceedingly
choice. Roughly classified to suit
the easy memories of the owners, it presents
an appearance urbane and unprecise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
rather than military and commanding. At
irregular intervals loom huge masses of
books, pamphlets, papers, proof-sheets and
engravings in cataclysmic disorder and apparently
suspended in mid air, like the
coffin of the False Prophet, but, in fact,
resting on tables well hidden by the superincumbent
piles. In this room the father
slowly accumulated this priceless treasure,
mostly illustrative of American history and
its adjuncts, thereby gratifying his own
accurate tastes and hoping, as we may suppose,
that his children would ultimately
profit by his foresight." No doubt the
father had such a hope, and before he
died he lived to enjoy the fullest realization
of it. At any rate, that room was
Paul Ford's college, and, later, his literary
workshop.</p>

<p>It might dull the reader's interest to
enter into a detailed account of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
early work that Ford did in his father's
library, but we may say that between 1886
and 1896 he published more than twenty
pamphlets and books bearing on American
historiography and bibliography, besides
the bulk of "The Writings of Thomas
Jefferson." As evidence of his prodigious
capacity for energy, we offer the list of
works which he published in the single
year 1889: "The Franklin Bibliography:
a list of books written by or relating to
Benjamin Franklin," "List of Some
Briefs in Appeal Cases Which Relate to
America Tried Before the Lords Commissioners
of Appeals of Prize Cases of His
Majesty's Privy Council, 1736-1758,"
"Check-List of American Magazines
Printed in the Eighteenth Century,"
"Check-List of Bibliographies, Catalogues,
Reference Lists, and Lists of Authorities
of American Books and Subjects," "Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Materials for a Bibliography of the Official
Publications of the Continental Congress
for 1774," "The Ideals of the Republic;
or Great Words from Great Americans,"
and "Who was the Mother of Franklin's
Son?"</p>

<p>His most notable historical works are
"The True George Washington," which
excited so much comment when it appeared
in 1896, and "The Many-Sided Franklin,"
published serially in <i>The Century
Magazine</i> a few years ago. Though he
may take advantage of moods, he does not
wait for moods. They say that Alphonse
Daudet was such a man of moods that two
months would pass sometimes and leave
the paper before him still blank. Ford is
Daudet's antithesis in this respect. His
pen is always ready. Perhaps this characteristic
is one of the advantages of pursuing
diverse interests. Yet, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the immense amount of literature
which he has produced already, the New
Yorker is as painstaking as one of those
Japanese artists who will labor for years
on a single vase. Once, when half-way
through a book, he discovered that he was
reaching the wrong conclusion, so he destroyed
what he had done and began again.
Only a writer with a heroic disregard of
time and effort, and with a sincere purpose
and unlimited zeal, would make such a
sacrifice. It is what we should expect of
every master-craftsman, yet we fear that
the deed is uncommon enough.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford's high reputation as a novelist
was established by "The Honorable Peter
Stirling." Much of the success of the
novel was due without doubt to the report
that the hero of it was none other than
the Hon. Grover Cleveland. Technically
the story has only a slight value; or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
it is fairer to say that its literary
merit rises and falls. There are passages
that drag; there are clumsy passages; there
are amusing unrealities; and there are
scenes photographic in their portrayal of
metropolitan life. Then, again, the broad
theme naturally interested the public&mdash;that
great led and leading mass of humanity
with its mercurial temper and shifting
whims and deep sympathies. The strength
and the weakness of the book&mdash;its literary
dimness and its popular attractiveness&mdash;are
illustrated in Stirling's speech at the
Coldman trial.</p>

<p>"The event of the trial came, however,
when Peter summed up. He spoke quietly,
in the simplest language, using few adjectives
and no invectives. But as the girl at
the Pierce's dinner had said: 'He describes
things so that one sees them.' He told
of the fever-stricken cows, and he told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the little fever-stricken children in such a
way that the audience sobbed; his clients
almost had to be ordered out of court; the
man next Dummer mopped his eyes with
his handkerchief; the judge and jury
thoughtfully covered their eyes (so as to
think better); the reporters found difficulty
(owing to the glary light) in writing
the words, despite their determination not
to miss one; and even the prisoner wiped
his eyes in his sleeve. Peter was unconscious
that he was making a great speech;
great in its simplicity, and great in its
pathos. He afterward said that he had
not given it a moment's thought and had
merely said what he felt. Perhaps his conclusion
indicated why he was able to
speak with the feeling he did. For he
said:</p>

<p>"'This is not merely the case of the
State <i>versus</i> James Coldman. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
case of the tenement-house children against
the inhumanity of man's greed.'"</p>

<p>A vivid picture sketched crudely, judged
from the artistic view-point; but a picture
to touch the heart of the people. This
human element in the story, together with
the popular idea that the hero was the distinguished
statesman now resident in
Princeton, made "The Honorable Peter
Stirling" one of the most successful books
of its day.</p>

<p>In a greater or less degree these merits
and defects are reflected in "The Story of
an Untold Love" and in "The Great
K. &amp; A. Train Robbery," but "Janice
Meredith" reveals marked literary improvement.
Janice is unquestionably the least
artificial of all his female characters. In
"Janice Meredith," too, the author is on
familiar ground. One has only to compare
his Washington with the Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
whom Thackeray pictured in "The Virginians"
to realize fully that while the English
novelist was the abler writer the
American is the closer student.</p>

<p>It would be absurd for even the author's
warmest admirer to set up the claim that
"Janice Meredith" is the great American
historical novel; and although some of the
friendly critics have vaguely hinted as
much, no one, we believe, has boldly gone
to the extremity of a proclamation. But
it must in all justice be said that the book
contains some of the elements which one
day will entitle a story to that phenomenal
distinction. Notable among these elements
are a glowing imaginativeness and a rare
faithfulness of historical portraiture.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift has fortunately given us a
description of the author with his pen in
hand. "A spirit of restlessness takes hold
upon Mr. Ford when he is hardest at work,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
he says, "and he shifts at pleasure from one
to another of his several desks or tables.
I should imagine that the curiosity hunter
of the future who might wish to possess
the desk at which or the chair on which
the author of 'Peter Stirling' sat when he
penned that book, might comfortably fill
a storage-warehouse van with new-found
joys. Like most good fellows who write,
Mr. Ford knows the value of the night and
often works to best advantage when honest
folk have been long abed." Again, Ford
is described as being alive to every issue
of the day and of the hour. He is brilliant
at conversation, and perhaps more brilliant
at controversy, "for," says Mr. Swift, "I
can imagine no opposing argument so
bristling with facts as to prevent his making
a cavalry charge on a whole table of
unsympathetic listeners. Life is at its
keenest pitch when one is privileged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
hear his urgent voice, with no little command
withal in its notes, and to see the
invincible clearness and dominance in his
black-brown eyes."</p>

<p>We can conclude with no happier remark
than that, so far as fiction is concerned, at
least, Mr. Ford seems destined to win still
greater honors than those already in his
possession.</p>

<h2>ROBERT NEILSON STEPHENS<a id="stephens"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">A</span></i><span class="smcap">s</span> we write this sketch, we have in
mind the familiar picture of Robert
Louis Stevenson, stretched out
on a couch in his Samoan home, ailing,
working. There is a sad sweetness in the
sharpened face, and in the eyes is a gleam
of bravery or determination. The Scot
whom the entire reading world still loves
so dearly, and will continue to love, it
seems, when the babes of to-day are trembling
graybeards, knew the strenuous life
much more intimately than most of its new
advocates; but it was a part of his art, and
the artist conceals his art. Stevenson's
sentences glitter, for they are gems of literature;
but the glitter was given them at
the expense of sublime patience and infinite
pains. Unconsciously he presented an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of heroism; consciously he showed
the young writers of his day that anything
approaching perfection must be the product
of scrupulous industry. Like the diamond
polisher, he was never satisfied with
a merely smooth facet: the facet dazzled or
he was not content.</p>

<p>We have Stevenson in mind at this time
for many reasons. In the first place, the
subject of this chapter, Robert Neilson
Stephens, may know of the letter of congratulation
which, when he was writing for
the <i>Philadelphia Press</i>, some of the young
men of that journal sent to the distinguished
writer on the Pacific island; and
possibly he may have seen the answer that
Stevenson sent&mdash;an answer filled with
modest thanks and sound advice and sincere
good wishes. The letter ended with
the remark that if the young Philadelphians
labored skillfully and ambitiously they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
would surely make their mark. If Stevenson
had lived he would have congratulated
Robert Neilson Stephens four years ago.</p>

<p>You will notice that there is a certain
similarity between the features of the author
of "The Master of Ballantrae" and the
author of "Philip Winwood"&mdash;the same
delicacy, the same lurking kindness, the
same suggestion of indomitable intellectuality.
And the resemblance extends beyond
the features, also. Stevenson, in his
youth, suffered from poverty; so did Stephens.
The Scotchman for a long time
dipped his pen in water, making no impression,
receiving no encouragement, entertaining
no luck; so, also, did the American.
It is a story almost as old as the world, a
story illustrated occasionally in the skies.
Astronomers tells us that light, fast as it
travels, takes years upon years to come to
us. Often it is the same with men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
genius: they blaze long before our narrow
vision gives any sign of recognition.</p>

<p>Someone, by the way, once sympathized
with Stephens on his ill health. Yes, he
was far from strong, he admitted; "but,"
he said, "they may say what they please&mdash;those
who have never been poor&mdash;I would
rather be ill and well-to-do, as I am, than
poor and in good health, as I was for many
years. I have had many sorrows, but hardly
a sorrow that was not aggravated, if not
caused, by poverty, or that very moderate
wealth would not have ameliorated or prevented.
The difference between pecuniary
ease and poverty is oftentimes simply as the
difference between heaven and hell."</p>

<p>We may not all agree with the sentiment
suggested, that riches in most circumstances
or under most conditions are preferable to
poverty with good health, but no one can
fail to discern in the sentiment the bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
memory of a man who has been acquainted
with great distress. At any rate, his is a
philosophy based on experience. To experience,
also, we may ascribe Stephens's
animadversion regarding friendship.</p>

<p>"When a man makes any kind of success,
however small," he says, "he finds
that his old friends resolve themselves into
three classes. The first class turn sullen,
and show their envy in many mean ways.
The second class wax more friendly than
ever, and come showering their attentions.
The third class show a reasonable pleasure
at your success, and remain just as they
were before. God bless the last kind! God
mend the second! and God pity the first!"</p>

<p>Before generalizing farther it might be
better to reveal some of Stephens's career.
Robert Neilson Stephens, a descendant of
the Jacobite fugitive who was grandfather
of Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
born on July 22, 1867, in New Bloomfield,
a little town in Central Pennsylvania. The
house in which he was born lay a stone's
throw from the academy founded by his
grandfather and conducted by his father.</p>

<p>The first distressful event came into
Robert's life when, at the age of nine, some
seven years after the family had moved
from New Bloomfield to Huntingdon, on
the Juniata River, his father died. His
mother, to support her children, took a position
as a school teacher. Notwithstanding
the lack of wealth, however, Robert
went through the public high school. After
leaving school he went to work, for three
dollars and a half a week, in a bookstore
connected with a stationery factory. Aside
from his pride and his poverty, which seem
to have influenced him to no small extent,
he was a delicate youth, and his steadiest
companions were books. Besides, he cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
assiduously the faculty of observation.
This cultivation shows itself in his books.
He is unsurpassed among the novelists of
the day for mastery of the life of bygone
periods.</p>

<p>The work in the bookstore was distasteful
to him in many ways. The narrowness
and the ignorance of the factory hands
chafed his delicate sensibilities; the nature
of the work itself jarred on his always
strengthening mental equipment. He looked
about him for a means of escape from this
sort of prison, incarceration in which was
little sweetened by the fact that in the second
year his salary was raised to four dollars
and a half. One of the modes of
escape which he attempted was stenography.
By assiduous practice he acquired such facility
in this branch of writing that the
Hon. John Scott, solicitor-general of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, aided by Mr. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
B. Wilson, an old friend of the boy's
father, before long secured him a position
in the railroad company's office in Philadelphia.
When settled down, Robert
brought his mother and brother to the city
on the Delaware.</p>

<p>But, pleasant as its environment was, the
young stenographer saw in his new position
no very rosy future. It was not&mdash;as it is
not to-day&mdash;his disposition to confound
mere comfort with success. We have
quoted his remark that he would rather be
rich and sick than poor and well; but we
venture to think that the riches of Mr.
Rockefeller would fail to give him absolute
satisfaction so long as the feeling of professional
success were absent from him. At
any rate, we judge by his present pursuits
and aims that his ideal is nearer to the revered
and affluent workman, like Zola, for
example, than like to a man whose sole object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
is the enjoyment and disbursement of
dollars and cents.</p>

<p>From the Pennsylvania road he went to
the <i>Philadelphia Press</i>, which in those days
was a veritable cradle of authors. Here
his literary instinct took hold of him. It
had taken hold of him once before, in Huntingdon,
one vacation, when he had worked
as printer's devil in the office of a weekly
newspaper, and, as often happens to "devils,"
had been stricken down with what
may be called typographical fever. The
great are not alone in the enjoyment of
authorship. We believe that Mr. Stephens's
first literary offering, an article describing
the joys and woes of budding printers, appeared
in that Huntingdon weekly.</p>

<p>That, however, was a mere juvenile spasm.
It was nothing like the powerful impulse
that came to him just previous to his début
as a writer of theatrical notices for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
<i>Press</i>. He showed so marked an aptitude
for this employment that within a year he
was virtually in full charge of the paper's
important dramatic column. Stephens's
career on the <i>Press</i> was as varied as that
of the average newspaper man, and, consequently,
as interesting and precious. For
the patience that, like the steam-drill, bores
its way through every obstacle; for accumulative
industry, for tireless zeal, for unaffected
modesty dashed with power, for
knowledge of the overt and covert ways of
men&mdash;for such a unique mixture of crude
virtue and wisdom combined commend us
to the enthusiastic journalist.</p>

<p>Stephens unconsciously heeded Stevenson's
caution and retired from journalism
before its hypnotic spell had taken complete
possession of him. One of the reasons
for his retirement from journalism was the
singular rule made by the <i>Press</i> that members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of its staff must not write for any other
periodical. Stephens had been fortunate in
placing his extra work, and naturally he
felt that the rule shut out promising opportunities.</p>

<p>Besides, in 1889, he had married&mdash;Mrs.
Stephens was, before her marriage, Miss
Maude Helfenstein, of Chicago&mdash;and there
were other reasons for his practical view
of the situation. There was no risk in the
retirement, for he had made many friends
while on the <i>Press</i>, especially among the inhabitants
of the theatrical world. He received
and accepted, in 1893, an offer to
become general agent for a firm of theatrical
managers.</p>

<p>Incidentally he was required to write
cheap plays&mdash;plays for the vulgar public
that Gautier despised and ridiculed. These
dutiful efforts are hardly noteworthy, but we
must mention "On the Bowery," a melodrama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
which afforded the picturesque and
withal good-hearted Steve Brodie a chance
to be heroic some sixty-four times a week.
But although this grade of work was uncongenial
to the author, it opened the way
to a better field, and, in September, 1896,
his play, "An Enemy to the King," written
during the winter of 1894-95, was produced
in New York by E. H. Sothern. As
this was his first ambitious production, the
author displayed some lack of nerve. Instead
of accompanying his wife to the theatre,
he shrank back to a nearby comfortable
refuge, whither, between the acts, a friend
brought him tidings of the performance.
The call for him was led by Richard Harding
Davis and DeWolf Hopper, who, running
across him outside the theatre, half
suffocated him with congratulatory embraces.
By and by Mr. Sothern took the
successful play to Boston; and there happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the circumstance which established
the author's fame.</p>

<p>The play was seen in Boston by Mr. L.
Coues Page, the Boston publisher, who,
recognizing in it the elements which constitute
a popular semi-historical romance,
and foreseeing the extensive demand for
that branch of literature, sought the author
and proposed that he should make a novel
out of his play. The proposal was readily
accepted; in fact the contract was signed
twenty-four hours after the author and publisher
had first met.</p>

<p>The instantaneous popularity of the book,
which was published in the fall of 1897,
had a two-sided effect: it induced the author
to abandon hack-work entirely and devote
his best energy and proficiency to fiction.</p>

<p>It is deeply to be regretted that Stephens's
health declined simultaneously with his
procession to the seats of the famous, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
these distressing conditions are hardly discernible
in either the quantity or the quality
of his work. In April, 1898, his second
novel, "The Continental Dragoon," appeared,
and in the following June the latest
of his plays, "The Ragged Regiment," was
produced at the Herald Square Theatre,
New York. In October of that year appeared
his third novel, "The Road to
Paris"; in May, 1899, "A Gentleman
Player"; in May, 1900, his highly popular
Revolutionary romance, "Philip Winwood,"
written almost entirely in England,
and published on the same day in England,
Canada, and the United States. His latest
novel, "Captain Ravenshaw," in which he
returns to the scene of "A Gentleman
Player"&mdash;Elizabethan London&mdash;has just
reached the public.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of "A
Gentleman Player," the novelist, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
assurance of a handsome income and of
consequent ease, went abroad with his wife.
Abroad he has lived ever since. This fall,
we understand, he will spend traveling on
the Continent. The first part of the winter
he plans to pass in Italy or in Sicily, the
second part on the Riviera. The spring
of 1902 will find him in Paris, whence, by
the end of spring, he expects to start for
home. We say "home" purposely, for we
are told that his protracted residence abroad
has served if anything to deepen and enliven
his loyalty to his native land.</p>

<p>We have been privileged to read the
preface to "Captain Ravenshaw." The
main part of it is a spirited and well-pointed
defence of the neo-romanticists against the
eccentric assault of Mr. William Dean
Howells. Then, referring to the book itself,
Stephens goes on to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, as to this little attempt at romance
in a certain kind, I wish merely to
say, for the benefit of those who turn over
the first leaves of a novel in a bookstore or
library, before deciding whether to take it
or leave it, that it differs from the usual
adventure story in being concerned merely
with private life and unimportant people.
Though it has incidents enough, and perils
enough, it deals neither with war nor with
state affairs. It contains no royal person;
not even a lord&mdash;nor a baronet, indeed,
for baronets had not yet been invented at
the period of the tale. The characters are
every-day people of the London of the time,
and the scenes in which they move are the
street, the tavern, the citizen's house and
garden, the shop, the river, the public resort&mdash;such
places as the ordinary reader
would see if a miracle turned back time
and transported him to London in the closing
part of Elizabeth's reign. The atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of that place and time, as one may
find it best in the less known and more
realistic comedies of Shakespeare's contemporaries,
in prose narratives and anecdotes,
and in the records left of actual transactions,
strike us of the twentieth century as
a little strange, somewhat of a world which
we can hardly take to be real. If I have
succeeded in putting a breath of this
strangeness, this (to us) seeming unreality,
into this busy tale, and yet have kept the
tale vital with a human nature the same
then as now, I have done something not
altogether bad. Bad or good, I have been
a long time about it, for I have grown to
believe that though novel-reading properly
comes under the head of play, novel-writing
properly comes under the head of work.
My work herein has not gone to attain the
preciosity of style which distracts attention
from the story, or the brilliancy of dialogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
which&mdash;as the author of 'John Inglesant'
says, 'declares the glory of the author
more pregnantly than it increases reality
of effect.' My work has gone, very much,
to the avoidance of anachronisms. This
is a virtue possessed by few novels which
deal with the past, as only the writers of
such novels know. It may be a virtue
not worth achieving, but it was a whim of
mine to achieve it. Ill health forbade
fast writing, the success of my last previous
work permitted slow writing, and I
resolved to utilize the occasion by achieving
one merit which, as it required neither
genius nor talent, but merely care, was
within my powers. The result of my care
must appear as much in what the story
omits as in what it contains. The reader
may be assured at the outset, if it matters
a straw to him, that the author of this
romance of Elizabethan London (and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
neighborhood) is himself at home in Elizabethan
London; if he fails to make the
reader also a little at home there in the
course of the story, it is only because he
lacks the gift, or skill of imparting."</p>

<p>Months ago the demand for "Captain
Ravenshaw" was so great that the publishers
were forced to issue an unprecedentedly
large first edition. The present
circumstance is an eloquent commentary
on the increase of the author's power and
popularity.</p>

<p>That power and that popularity seem
destined to grow larger book by book.
The master of a most graceful style and of
diction unsurpassed for simplicity and clearness;
a trained observer, as every successful
writer must be; a diligent and uncommonly
perspicacious student of the periods
from which he takes his characters, the
author of "Captain Ravenshaw" promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
ably to sustain his already high reputation.
As the fulfilment of this promise depends
largely on the state of his health, we wish
him well, confident that in expressing the
wish we but echo the sentiment of his wide
circle of admirers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS<a id="roberts"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcapq">"P</span></i><span class="smcap">rofessor</span>" Roberts he is still
called by his old friends in New
Brunswick, and, so far as we know,
"Old Man" he is still called by his literary
companions. "The 'Old Man,'" said
Richard Hovey a few years ago, "he is
fondly called by the poets who are his companions,
not that he is so much the elder of
the group, but perhaps because he had already
achieved a certain measure of reputation
and was a full-fledged man of letters
when the others were just beginning their
callow boy-bows to the Muse. And the
name, given at the outset in a comic, mock-filial
mood, has stuck to him as a term of
endearment."</p>

<p>Hovey&mdash;may he rest in peace!&mdash;loved
and admired Roberts. He said so in writing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
he said so o' nights in the company of
his old friends in Boston. Hovey had a
manner that would remind one of the rivers
branching off Roberts's familiar Bay of
Fundy. At first, a stranger, you found it
empty; in a few moments, if he offered you
the right hand of fellowship, it was flooding
with a warm tide.</p>

<p>We could readily go on for a page or two
speaking of the lamented singer, and of
what it meant to know him as a friend&mdash;to
share his hospitality and his sympathy.
But it occurs to us that some reader may be
inquiring why the professor from New
Brunswick has been brought into a book on
American authors. We might answer, with
a smile, to incite him to become as loyal an
American as General Wallace or Mark
Twain. Or we might repeat as an answer a
statement made to us not long ago by an
observant inhabitant of this part of the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
world&mdash;"Professor Roberts is quite as
good an American as Henry James." But,
using American in its fullest sense, Roberts
easily comes in under that head. The
shadow of the Stars and Stripes falls near
his birthplace. His public is largely a
purely American public. His residence for
the last four years has been New York
City. He is perhaps the most gifted author
reared in late decades by our lovely neighbor,
the Dominion of Canada, his alma
mater&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O child of nations, giant-limbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who stand'st among the nations now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheeded, unadored, unhymned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With unanointed brow!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Speaking of Roberts in <i>The Writer</i> once,
his friend Hovey said: "All his excursions
include a return ticket to the Maritime
Provinces, and 'Up and Away in the
Morning' is always for the sake of 'Home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Home in the Evening.'" This statement
has been contradicted by Roberts's life during
the last few years. He is to be found
in New York winter and summer.</p>

<p>At the same time we should be stultifying
ourselves to deny his loyalty to his
native land. It lives in many of his pages;
it is kept aflame by ties of family and of
friendship. The beautiful part of the
world northeast of New England has been
to him nursery, academy and studio. Indeed,
one who knew him well has said:
"He is neither Briton nor American, but
assertively Canadian; and, if history ever
make his dream a reality, his own poems
will not have been an entirely negligible
factor in bringing it to pass."</p>

<p>Charles George Douglass Roberts, M.A.,
F.R.S.C., F.R.S.L., was born in Douglas,
at the mouth of the Keswick River, near
Fredericton, New Brunswick, on January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
10, 1860. His father, the Rev. G. Goodridge
Roberts, M.A., the son of Professor George
Roberts, Ph.D., is the rector of the English
church in Fredericton, and also the
canon of Christ Church Cathedral. His
mother, Emma Wetmore Bliss Roberts,
comes of what used to be known as United
Empire Loyalist stock&mdash;the same stock,
by the way, that Emerson's mother came
of. Her ancestors left the colonies for the
provinces at the outbreak of the American
Revolution. There were many influential
families among the Loyalists, and, on the
whole, their headstrong flight has been
beneficial to the land 'way down East. The
novelist's mother, it should be said, is a sister
of Bliss Carman's mother, which makes
the two young writers, Roberts and Carman,
cousins by blood as well as brothers by
profession. A strong intellectual ancestry
has Roberts, it will be seen, an ancestry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that fully accounts for the circumstance
that his sister and his two younger brothers
are skillful at versification.</p>

<p>The first fourteen years of Roberts's life
were spent in Woodstock, of which parish his
father was then the rector, and up to the
end of these fourteen years Charles's education
had been personally supervised by his
father. Fortunate conditions!&mdash;as they
who have missed such supervision can most
eloquently testify. Ideal conditions, if we
are to accept the well-digested opinion of
scholastic as well as of medical experts.</p>

<p>The Robertses moved from Woodstock to
Fredericton in 1874. At Fredericton,
Charles attended the Collegiate School.
Chief among those who fitted the boy for
college was Dr. George R. Parkin, who,
although now the head of Upper Canada
College, Toronto, has perhaps been most
prominent as an Imperial Federationist advocate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
In 1876 young Roberts was
matriculated at the University of New
Brunswick. As for his progress there, no
more need be said than that he won the
Douglas silver medal for Latin and Greek,
the alumni gold medal for the Latin essay,
and a classical scholarship. In 1879 he
was graduated with honors in ethics, metaphysics
and political economy. That same
year he was appointed head master of the
Chatham (N. B.) Grammar School. The
next year, 1880, chronicled two notable
events&mdash;his marriage, and the publication
of his first book, "Orion and Other
Poems."</p>

<p>In 1881, at the University of New Brunswick,
he took his degree of Master of Arts
for Greek and higher mathematics. During
the next two years he taught school in
Fredericton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there came a brief excursion which
may have illustrated his doubts about a
career. He left off teaching and went to
Toronto. There, with the assistance of
Goldwin Smith, he established <i>The Week</i>,
the most important of the Canadian literary
periodicals. He relinquished this work
the following year to take the chair of
English and French literature in King's
College, Windsor, Nova Scotia. In 1887
he abandoned the French department for
the department of Economics and International
Law. At Windsor he lived in a
house in the balmy woods&mdash;"Kingscroft,"
he called it&mdash;and there he planned three
books&mdash;"The Forge in the Forest," his
first Acadian romance; "The Book of the
Native," and "A History of Canada."</p>

<p>These plans compelled the abandonment
of teaching, so, in 1895, Roberts left King's
College and returned to Fredericton. At
the age of thirty-five, therefore, he formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
adopted the profession of literature.</p>

<p>Early in 1897 he moved to New York,
where for eight months he was associate
editor of <i>The Illustrated American</i>. Since
then he has directed his efforts wholly to
authorship.</p>

<p>And with the utmost justification. In narrative
and in descriptive power he shines
brilliantly among his contemporaries.
Hovey would not answer the question:
"Who is the greatest poet born on Canadian
soil?"&mdash;"but," he writes, "when I
say that Roberts is <i>par excellence</i> the 'Poet
of Canada,' I have little fear that anyone
will contradict me." There is his noble
hymn, "Canada," there is "Autochthon,"
there is "Kinship," there is "Origins"&mdash;poems
of faultless grace and deep-founded
sentiment and what one critic has termed
"chiselled, Parnassian calm." For example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mount, the star, the germ, the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all shall wake, they all shall sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time, like a flurry of wild rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall drift across the darkened pane.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Space, in the dim predestined hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall crumble like a ruined tower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only, with unfaltering eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall watch the dreams of Gods go by.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hovey, whom we may accept as an accomplished
judge of symbolist literature, put
"Do Seek their Meat from God" and "The
Young Ravens that call upon Him," two
sketches in "Earth's Enigmas," and "Savory
Meats," a story published in the <i>Chap-Book</i>,
together, and said that they "form an altogether
unique and extraordinary triptych.
I am inclined to think these three pieces,"
he says, "Roberts's most notable contribution
to literature. The problem of the
struggle for existence, of the preying of life
on life, is treated with an inexorable fidelity
to the fact, a catholic sympathy, a sense of
universality and mystery, and a calm acceptance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
that reaches the level of 'pathos' in
the highest Greek usage of the word. There
is a finality in these three prose poems
that is known only to the greatest art."</p>

<p>As for Robert's novels, they are full of
the perfumed freshness, the vigorous life
and the romantic wealth which constituted,
and to a small extent still constitute, the
salient characteristics of the lands in which
he spent his youth. We have noted his
narrative and descriptive power. Let us
take from "A Sister to Evangeline" one
of Paul Grande's visions of Yvonne de
Lamourie.</p>

<p>"In one of these I saw her as she stood
a certain morning in the orchard, prying
with insistent little finger-tips into the heart
of a young apple-flower, while I watched
and said nothing. I know not to this day
whether she were thinking of the apple-flower
or wondering at the dumbness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
cavalier; but she feigned, at least, to concern
herself with only the blossom's heart.
Her wide white lids downcast over her great
eyes, her long lashes almost sweeping the
rondure of her cheek, she looked a Madonna.
The broad, low forehead; the
finely chiselled nose, not too small for
strength of purpose; the full, firm chin&mdash;all
added to this sweet dignity, which was
of a kind to compel a lover's worship.
There was enough breadth to the gracious
curve below the ear to make me feel that
this girl would be a strong man's mate.
But the mouth, a bow of tenderness, with
a wilful dimple at either delectable corner
always lurking, spoke her all woman, too
laughing and loving to spend her days in
sainthood. Her hair&mdash;very thick and of a
purply-bronze, near to black&mdash;lay in careless
fullness over her little ears. On her head,
though in all else she affected the dress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Grand Pré maids, she wore, not the Acadian
linen cap, but a fine shawl of black Spanish
lace, which became her mightily. Her
bodice was of linen homespun, coarse, but
bleached to a creamy whiteness; and her
skirt, of the same simple stuff, was short
after the Acadian fashion, so that I could
see her slim ankles, and feet of that exceeding
smallness and daintiness which may
somehow tread heavily upon a man's
heart."</p>

<p>And there is a strong resemblance to
Thomas Hardy in at least one of the paragraphs
narrating Paul Grande's race with
death toward the Anderson farm&mdash;the
paragraph dealing with the idle things that
then incongruously concerned the hero:</p>

<p>"Things idle as these: I see a dew-wet
fir-top catch the moonlight for an instant
and flash to whiteness, an up-thrust lance
of silver; I see the shadow of a dead, gnarled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
branch cast upon a mossy open in startling
semblance to a crucifix&mdash;so clear, I cannot
but stoop and touch it reverently as I pass;
I see, at the edge of a grassy glade, a company
of tall buttercups, their stems invisible,
their petals seeming to float toward me, a
squadron of small, light wings; I hear the
smooth swish of branches thrust apart; I
hear the protesting, unresonant creak of the
green underbrush as we tread it down, and
the sharp crackle of dry twigs as we thread
the aisles of older forest; I hear, from the
face of a moonlit bluff upon our left, the
long, mournful <i>Whóo-hu-hu&mdash;Hóo-oo</i> of the
brown owl. I smell the savour of juniper,
of bruised snakeroot, and of old, slow-rotting
wood; with once a fairy breath of unseen
<i>lin&oelig;a</i>; and once at the fringed brink of a
rivulet, the pungent fragrance of wild mint.
I feel the frequent wet slappings of branches
on my face; I feel the strong prickles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
fir, the cool, flat frondage of the spruce and
hemlock, the unresisting, feathery spines of
the young hackmatack trees; I feel, once, a
gluey web upon my face, and the abhorrence
with which I dash off the fat spider
that clings to my chin; I feel the noisome
slump of my foot as I tread upon a humped
and swollen gathering of toad-stools."</p>

<p>More than one judicious critic has remarked
that few men of his years have
achieved&mdash;and deservedly!&mdash;the literary
renown which Professor Roberts's published
works warrant. These works are as follows:
"Orion and Other Poems" (1880),
"In Divers Tones" (1887), "The Canadians
of Old" (a translation from the
French of de Gaspé, 1889), Appleton's
"Canadian Guide Book" (1890), "Ave,
An Ode for the Shelley Centenary" (1892),
"Songs of the Common Day" (1893),
"The Raid of Beauséjour" (1894), "Reub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Dare's Shad Boat" (1895), "Around the
Camp Fire" (1896), "Earth's Enigmas"
(1896), "A History of Canada" (1897),
"The Forge in the Forest" (1897), "The
Book of the Native" (1897), "New York
Nocturnes" (1898), "A Sister to Evangeline"
(1898), "By the Marshes of Minas"
(1900), "The Heart of the Ancient
Wood" (1900).</p>

<p>However, notwithstanding this long and
excellent literary record, we are assured that
Roberts "has a keen fondness for athletics.
He is an enthusiastic football and tennis
player, canoeist and fisherman, and is
equally as skilled in these as he is in the
pursuits of literature."</p>

<p>Another novel from his pen, "Barbara
Ladd," appears this fall. "I consider it,"
he writes, "a sort of cross between 'The
Heart of the Ancient Wood' and a
historical-psychological romance." As for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
future, he says: "Next will probably appear
a collection of poems, and a collection
of animal stories. Then another romance,
planned but not yet named; and then, if
the Fates are very good to me, I'll take
time for a long lyrical drama on which I
have been engaged off and on for some
years."</p>

<h2>WINSTON CHURCHILL<a id="churchill"></a></h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">L</span></i><span class="smcap">ate</span> in the year 1900 it suddenly
became plain to some of the mystified
inhabitants of the literary world
that there were two Winston Churchills.</p>

<p>It is indeed remarkable how long the
error lived which confounded Winston L. S.
Churchill, war correspondent and politician,
and eldest son of Lord Randolph Churchill,
with plain Winston Churchill, the author of
"Richard Carvel."</p>

<p>The error cropped out soon after the
beginning of the South African war, when
the Englishman, at a place called Estcourt,
took gallant part in the defence of an armored
train bound to the relief of Ladysmith.
It was the result of one of the
sentences in the report of the action:
"Winston Churchill's brilliant behavior is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
compared with the gallant action in the
Tirah campaign, which won the Victoria
cross for Lord Fincastle, who was also acting
as a newspaper correspondent."</p>

<p>Immediately some persons, who should
have known better, jumped to the conclusion
that this Winston Churchill was the
author of a book then extremely popular
in this country. It is a notable commentary
on the persistency of false ideas that the two
Churchills were not, in certain quarters,
positively distinguished from each other
until they met in Boston the middle of last
December. It was an interesting meeting,
as we gather from the notes of a witness.</p>

<p>"The young, light-haired Englishman
was in bed, in his room at the Touraine,
shortly after noon, when Major J. B. Pond
arrived with a heavily built six-footer,
smooth-shaven, dark-complexioned, a pair
of merry black eyes, and a rather thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
body encased in a raglan of dark gray.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Churchill, Mr. Churchill,' said the
Major. The man on the bed turned over
on his side and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry to find that you are ill,' said
the Churchill in the raglan, as he caught
the outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"'Nothing serious, I guess,' said the
other; 'been travelling, you know. But, I
say, how came you by that name?'</p>

<p>"The author of 'Richard Carvel' smiled.</p>

<p>"'The first trace of it I can find in the
family,' he said, 'is about 1851. It seems
that there have been Winston Churchills
over here for a good many years.'</p>

<p>"Then there was an exchange of bouquets.
Winston Churchill said that he had always
been looking forward with pleasure to a
meeting with his namesake, and the other
Churchill said something in the same strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I was interested when I read your
first book,' said the Englishman. 'Didn't
think a great deal of that book; but the
other one, "Richard Carvel," I was willing
to become responsible for that.'</p>

<p>"Then it developed that each had been
responsible for the other to a greater or less
extent. For this reason it was inevitable
that they should meet."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, mail for the Englishman,
simply directed "Winston Churchill,
Boston, Mass.," had been sent to his namesake's
residence on Beacon Street. Later
it was told that the American met the same
embarrassment in London. "When I was
staying at Brown's Hotel," he said to the
Parliamentarian, "I found it almost impossible
to get my mail. They compelled me
to sign for it personally."</p>

<p>The Englishman, by the way, is the
author of a romance in regard to which the
London critics seem to hold an opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
similar to that which he admittedly holds
in regard to the American's first novel&mdash;"The
Celebrity."</p>

<p>Speaking of "The Celebrity" reminds us
of the still prevalent notion that its contemptible
hero is Mr. Richard Harding
Davis. In fact we believe that the author
was openly charged with having written the
satire merely to pay a private grudge.
We heard an echo of the charge as late as
this year. Yet, more than two years ago
Mr. Churchill, in a public letter, took pains
specifically to deny the imputation. "The
Celebrity" he said, in effect, was entirely
an imaginary work. No one at all resembling
the chief character had ever been met
by him. So far from paying grudges, he
had no grudge to pay. Indeed, the young
writer grew so tender on the subject that
the Colonial atmosphere of "Richard Carvel"
was attributed to his desire to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
contemporary themes. But the truth is,
he completed "The Celebrity" while temporarily
short of historical material for use
in the history of Richard and his Dorothy.
Twice he thoroughly revised "The Celebrity"
before sending it to the publishers.</p>

<p>And who is this Winston Churchill? He
is the son of Spalding Churchill of Maine
and Emma Bell Blaine of St. Louis, and he
was born in the Missouri metropolis on Nov.
10, 1871. The first sixteen years of his
life were spent in his birthplace; and there,
at Smith Academy, he prepared for college.
The college proved to be the Naval Academy
at Annapolis.</p>

<p>As a boy he was inclined to be uncommonly
studious, but at the Naval Academy
he developed a strong inclination towards
athletics. It was largely owing to his
energy and his enthusiasm that the cadets
revived rowing. Like most other cadets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
he learned to fence expertly; and you will
find an intimate knowledge of this accomplishment
in his treatment of one of the
most dramatic scenes in "Richard Carvel."
He took to horseback riding, also to golf
and to tennis, in short, to all the pastimes
that strengthen the body and enliven the
mind. It is his devotion to physical exercise
which has enabled him to work long
and hard without distress.</p>

<p>He felt, before his graduation from
Annapolis, that his place was at the writing
table, not on the deck of a man-o'-war.
Apropos of which he has said: "When a
man is being trained for a definite career, it
helps him to make up his mind as to his
tastes and abilities. If he is sure he doesn't
want to do that particular thing, he
must know pretty definitely what he does
want to do. When he throws over a certainty
for a chance his heart must be firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
set on the kind of work involved in the
chance. For this reason a technical school
helps some men to find their vocation better
than four years at a university, where the
training is general."</p>

<p>In 1894 he became editor of the
<i>Army and Navy Journal</i>. The following
year he joined the staff of the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>
at Irvington-on-the-Hudson. While working
for the magazine he took as wife Miss Mabel
Harlakenden Hall of St. Louis, whose fortune
induced him to give up magazine work
altogether and devote himself to the realization
of his dreams.</p>

<p>Now if Churchill lacked either determination
or genius the wealth that through
marriage he became a sharer in would have
have availed him little. He might have
attracted some attention as a dilettante, or
he might have done the things that a
wealthy person alone can do&mdash;establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
another <i>Anglo-Saxon Review</i>, for example,
or publish small thoughts in editions de
luxe. He would have succeeded if his wife
had never brought him a copper. It would
have taken him longer to succeed, that is all.
Art is long, and life is short only to the poor
fellow who must ascend the ladder round by
round. But not all the money in the world
can ease the labor of the brain.</p>

<p>Churchill's ambition, from the first
moment that he felt the literary impulse,
was to write a historical novel. Annapolis
had fired his imagination. "Seeing those
old houses," he once said, "which used to be
the scenes of the gayest and happiest social
life before the Revolution&mdash;they look as if
the people had just gone out of them&mdash;and
reading the history of the town as it used to
be, interested me greatly in a certain aspect
of the life of the colonial planters, which
had not, it seemed to me, been fully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
truthfully expressed in a novel. What I
wanted to do in 'Richard Carvel' was to
give a picture of the life of colonial Maryland
and Virginia, with special reference to
Annapolis, and to contrast the people who
made it with the corresponding element in
England. One of the things I wanted to
bring out strongly was that, although the
leading men in business, in professional life,
and in politics, in both Maryland and London,
came from the same stock, a few generations
back, politically, the British had
sunk into a state of gross corruption and
degradation, while the Americans were
men of the highest integrity and the cleanest
motives, mindful of their legal and moral
debt to Great Britain, but resolute not to
endure more than a certain amount of
injustice."</p>

<p>And how do you suppose Mr. Churchill
prepared for the big task of writing a historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
novel? He has answered the question
himself:</p>

<p>"By visiting all the places concerned in
the story, and by reading biographies, histories,
memoirs, letters, old newspapers&mdash;in
fact, everything which could give me an
insight into the life of those days, or into
the character of the people like John Paul
Jones and Charles Fox, whom I desired to
introduce. Of course I read a great deal
too much; a great many books gave me no
direct help and added nothing to what I had
already learned; but I have no doubt that
all this reading counted in the way of letting
me into the spirit and the atmosphere
and the ideas and the business methods and
the modes of life and thought of those days.
Of course, I took voluminous notes, and had
no end of trouble to keep them arranged so
that I could use them, in spite of the effort
I made to keep notes on costumes in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
volume, manners and customs in another,
unusual words and turns of expression
in another, incidents in another, character in
another, history in another and so on."</p>

<p>"Richard Carvel" was begun in St. Louis
not long after the author's marriage. It
was written over again for the fifth time
between October, 1898, and April, 1899, at
a little town on the Hudson, an hour's
journey from New York. Yet it is a proof
of Churchill's zeal and industry that in those
six months he visited the metropolis only
five times. His habit is to work from early
breakfast until one in the afternoon, and
then, after luncheon, for a few hours more,
after which he takes some physical exercise;
and after dinner he picks up the thread
of the story again. You see, his literary
methods are very simple; they mean work
early and late, work done doggedly, and as
scrupulously as if the keenest critic were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The furore which "Richard Carvel"
excited is too well remembered, we think,
to particularize on. The author was made
a lion of everywhere, truly, and exhibited in
all the gilded cages of the East. We recall
that the mere announcement of his purpose
to go to the theatre in New York was sufficient
to insure a big audience. Not another
one of our American authors whose fame is
of recent acquirement, and whose inclination
is to keep far from the madding crowd
has been followed about by so many hero-worshippers
as the author of "Richard
Carvel" was during the twelvemonth following
the publication of the book.</p>

<p>Was the attention justly merited? Undoubtedly.
"Richard Carvel" is an extraordinarily
powerful story. Its atmosphere is
vivid; its characters are excellently drawn;
its plot is skillfully laid; its action is vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and delightfully varied.</p>

<p>"Richard Carvel" was the first of a
series of historical novels which Churchill
planned just after leaving Annapolis. It
has been followed lately by the second
member of the series, "The Crisis," the
writing of which occupied nearly two years.
While thus engaged the author declined to
be interrupted. Naturally, after bounding
to the top of the ladder, anything which he
might have offered would have been accepted
by some publishers. "You have no
idea," he once remarked, "of the temptations
that are put in the way of a man
whose book has been accorded a popular
success." The temptations he brushed aside;
he made up his mind to pursue a straight
road. And wisely, for, as he argues,
"When a man makes a great reputation by
a single book, and then allows succeeding
books to go from his hands which do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
represent the very best work of which he is
capable, the public finds it out at once. No
matter if there is good work in these hastily
written books, people ignore them. I think
it is the worst thing a man can do for his
reputation to write books too fast. Of
course, it is the worst possible thing he can
do for his lasting reputation, which is the
thing really worth working for, but what
I mean is that it is the worst thing he can
do in the short run as well as in the long
run. Why, even speaking commercially,
which is the lowest and the least and the
last way in which one can look at these
things, it is a fatal mistake. And I think
a novelist makes a great mistake if he confines
himself to one period or writes several
books on one epoch, though it is more or
less the practice to-day. I think we ought
to go in more for versatility."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Churchill is seen in New York and
Boston in the winter; in the summer he is
to be found only by traveling 'way down
East. In Boston, particularly, the Churchills
have become very well known. There
Mr. Churchill puts up at the most aristocratic
clubs, and Mrs. Churchill graces the
most fashionable receptions.</p>
